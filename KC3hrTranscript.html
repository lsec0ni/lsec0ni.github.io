0:00
uh my brother and sister in Christ let's begin quick with a prayer in the name of the father and the son and of the Holy
0:05
Spirit my soul and gracious father how can we not begin with first without saying thank you for all the gifts you've given
0:12
us the ones we know and the ones we'll come to know we thank you for the presentation today and for Kyle and for
0:17
Valerie for coming out this way but more Overlord in your mother's name we pray Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with
0:25
thee blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus
0:30
holy Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners now unto the hour of our death
0:36
amen Our Lady Queen of Peace pray for us in the name of the father and the son the holy spirit amen we Witnesses Christ
0:43
yesterday if you and I were in the Seminary together and it's depending on whether you have an
0:49
undergraduate degree or graduate degree you may be there for four years five years six years you may have eight years
0:54
depending right one of the problems let me rephrase that one of the
1:00
challenges is is when you go through the Seminary um there's no Devil's Advocate 101.
1:06
there's no this is how the evil one works class you just kind of go through it and you
1:13
study Theology and liturgy and there's different components Etc but nobody's sitting down explaining how the Nemesis
1:20
works and so what happens is you get out and then you realize to me and I don't want to I hate using
1:27
this term but I believe the devil's greatest gift is the ability to convince you and I he doesn't exist
1:33
and therefore we see it play out in the world that we're in right just look at the world that we're
1:38
in if you don't believe the evil one exists just take a gander right so yesterday man I was very thankful for
1:45
Kyle and Valerie to come but he came early and we had about eight or ten priests that got to sit and listen to
1:50
him and talk to him because we're seeing more and more problems so how's the priest do we know how involved is the
1:58
Demonic is it psychological is it is it just a an addiction or is there some
2:04
component to it that is just it's just evil right and so we don't know what we don't know so yesterday I got to tell
2:12
you I it was just amazing to me how much you just pick up like
2:18
as a priest we don't we don't perceive we see the church is very hierarchical because we see it
2:24
there's there's Bishops and there's archbishops and there's Cardinals granted they're all more or less the
2:30
same except those that get to vote for the papa and then of course the the pope himself well what we never really think
2:36
about is that the evil one works exactly the same way except and then I'll use
2:43
Kyle's words it's actually inverted so in other words it's very hierarchical so when those nine choirs of angels that
2:49
fall from the sky they find they fall hierarchically and therefore they're very much their job description is their
2:57
job description if they're if they're an angel as I'll use his words that's dedicated towards the manger well then
3:04
he may be quote anti-manger that's my words right as an evil one so they you
3:09
just don't get the art they're not willy-nilly they're not shotgun artists they're really more of a sniper-esque if
3:15
you will so yesterday when we started talking I said ma'am as a lay we need to understand this how
3:22
he gets involved yesterday Kyle spent 20 to 30 minutes talking about the problems
3:28
with yoga I can tell you how many times that argument comes to my my desk and then
3:34
when you tell them man you really shouldn't be partaking in it they think you have 10 heads right well father I'm
3:39
just doing exercises okay I mean think about it but you know I
3:45
mean you know I thought it was a great description what if you exercised every day doing this
3:51
do you think that would have an influence on you sure would so now do it just the opposite therein lies the issue
3:57
so he and I tell you how we came to find out about Kyle is uh obviously father
4:03
rippinger is very popular and he's growing in popularity more people watching and myself included well as you
4:11
get to understand it calls very close to him he's been working with him and they both used to work I think the Leo
4:16
Institute correct right which is where we would send uh the Bishops would pick their boys who would be Exorcist and
4:22
then they would send them to quote school there's an exorcist school well they actually they've kind of got it
4:28
even more fine-tuned and now father rippinger and Kyle himself they actually have their own kind of Institute their
4:33
own school so this is where we're trying to get more guys to get involved right because how do we know
4:39
what is under the influence of him or not right but we don't and so therefore we
4:45
need to have that education as well bless salt holy water blessed relics while we do what we do with the mass why
4:52
you need to go to confession and stop winging it and going by yourself or talking to the big guy directly is this
4:57
somehow another you've been given a free pass even though Christ said in Hebrews 5 I will choose priests among men for
5:03
the Forgiveness of sins no one has taken upon themselves we just think we can go directly to the big guy I mean I'll be
5:09
honest with you as a Protestant I like going to the big guy it was just easier because it wasn't my fault especially in
5:16
college which was the best 10 years of my life thank you very much according to my father it wasn't my fault it was it
5:22
was the women it was y'all's fault okay I'm just saying okay my point being is
5:28
Kyle and and father rippinger are very close and as a result of it he kind of does the administration and as well as
5:35
the facilitating of everything from the diabolic to the influences to exorcisms
5:40
and help put the program together so that we would start thinking more along a linear path of how the evil one thinks
5:47
so that you can pick up on it so without any further Ado my brothers is in Christ
5:52
Kyle please come forward man thank you thank you
5:57
it's not very high checked but all right thank you Father man got you thank you
6:03
good morning so just a couple of things
6:08
um first of all everything I'm gonna share with you is
6:13
um hopefully experiential or
6:21
objective what does that mean I have no opinion purposefully I have no opinion all I can
6:29
tell you is what I see and so what do I see
6:34
for the what will you see after today is to look at the world objectively to
6:40
look at it the way um the Diabolical looks at it the Diabolical does not involved in or
6:47
interested in speculative theology he's not in interested in debating with
6:52
you the legitimacy of measure gorier he's not interested in any of those things
6:59
he's interested in selling you one little particle of a lie
7:05
amongst a lot of Truth and so how does that work
7:11
a good analogy is that how do you make a pearl
7:19
you put a grain of sand in an oyster or clam and he develops this construct around
7:27
that because that grain of sand is not supposed to be there and so then he develops this construct
7:34
this Pearl around it now if you invert that I'll give you a classic example of one
7:41
of the ways that he works and then we're going to talk about our disposition you have to have a dispositional shift how
7:46
many of you are familiar the way camouflage works everybody should have a pretty working
7:54
idea in this day and age of camo how do you break the camel pattern
8:00
you look for something that's inconsistent between the pattern and the natural surrounding and sometimes you
8:05
have to look pretty close often what is the structure what is the anatomical structure that gives up
8:12
a camel pattern it's going to be one of the organs of us of the sense the nose the eye the ear
8:19
you familiar with what I'm saying I mean how do you pick it out and so in the
8:25
same way that the ability to break that that Camel pattern is how you're going
8:30
to find him and it's how he's going to find you and so we'll go deeper into that I'm throwing some Concepts out there right
8:36
now today's talk is called the flow of Grace Grace is so important and misunderstood
8:42
and so we're going to kind of focus on the flow of Grace but I'm going to give you a couple of examples this may seem
8:49
like shots in the dark and then we'll pull them all together so bear with me and I'm not going to
8:54
pick on anybody but I'll give you a I'll make a suggestion to you
9:00
um this talk is being recorded you will have access to this talk
9:05
I would highly suggest you put your pins down and listen and then listen again and then listen
9:12
again and I got a hand out at the end that I'm going to give you at the end because if I give it to you now you're going to read it
9:20
news flash we are not meant to multitask and if he can get you to multitask he's
9:28
already hamstrung you and you may say well as a mother I have to multitask I understand that that term
9:35
is misused there's still a primary activity that's going on in your brain your body may be doing other things but
9:41
they're still a primary activity correct and your senses are attuned to that primary activity it's when we divide our
9:48
senses that we become vulnerable and that things pass Us by how many of
9:54
you have turned on that talk you really wanted to hear it's on the radio it's in your car you got it turned on and when
10:00
you get where you're going you don't remember a thing that was said so really and truly the ministry of
10:08
presence the ability to be 100 present to a person is one of the greatest gifts
10:14
you can give them to be a hundred percent present and so
10:19
that's important in the flow of Grace that that understanding of being a a right receptacle to the flow of Grace
10:26
and then we're going to talk about how to cultivate right disposition or resonance do you know what I mean when I
10:33
say resonance if I've got a crystal glass here and there's one in the back and I begin to
10:39
to ring that glass and it begins to vibrate what happens to the one in the back
10:44
it responds and so resonance is the understanding
10:49
that Hearts Souls respond to that sound wave that Grace
10:56
and they can respond positively and they can respond negatively they can respond individually they can respond
11:02
cumulatively how is your soul attuned
11:07
what are your relationships how do your relationships dispose of you toward
11:12
Grace and are those relationships consistent so this part of the talk is kind of like a Prelude you're getting
11:18
all kinds of little uh bits and pieces and you're thinking wait slow down talk about that slow down talk about that I'm
11:24
throwing all this up in the air you can't concentrate on one ball while it's being juggled but here in a minute we're
11:30
going to grab one ball and we're going to sit it here and we're going to talk about it till you get tired of me talking about it fair enough
11:36
so let's talk a little bit about resonance or disposition how can I alter
11:42
that glass in the back so that it does not respond to this Pure Glass in the
11:47
front another analogy is your chalice
11:52
your soul conforms so that it responds in resonance to the Chalice at the Holy
11:58
Mass what's happening in that chalice the
12:04
quickening of the of the wine into the sacred blood of Our Lord is your soul responding in resonance if
12:12
not why is your is your vessel a purified vessel are you in a state of grace are you
12:17
capable of being focused on what's going on so that it does resonate
12:23
or is your vessel damaged is it dirty is it soiled is it disposed to receive via
12:31
resonance that's which is going on here's not here's a couple examples of resonance
12:37
and it's been I'm Politically Incorrect so everybody ready to get over that good so
12:44
by the end of the day I will have in some way or another I will have probably offended each and every one of you
12:50
not my intent um so the truth Falls where it may we
12:56
all need that we all we all say I I want the truth and we do
13:03
we are capable in varying degrees of yielding and ordering our life to that truth
13:09
so know that don't worry about that the question is
13:15
how much truth do you want you guys have quite a bit of of desire
13:20
for truth and you guys have quite a bit of of seeking why do I say that it is a beautiful
13:27
Sunday morning uh Saturday morning the temperature is fantastic you're in in a
13:33
beautiful part of the world and like a fanatic you're sitting in a retreat
13:38
center listening to a talk and you are fanatics
13:43
there are members of your family who will back me up on that
13:49
thanks be to God so the disposition how many of you and
13:56
and I'm not asking for a show of hands but just listen interiorly how many of you will pick a physical
14:03
thing and we're all of an age in here um that we're all all Beyond teenagers
14:09
I'm pretty sure so how many of you have a different got some time in your life a
14:14
different respect for lower back pain
14:21
so there was a time in my life when you said lower back pain and I was like yeah that right
14:27
and I'd go get on another brawn my understanding of lower back pain is
14:33
way way different so I am more compassionately disposed I remember my Uncle Bob he would talk
14:39
about his back and and having to protect his back he never complained but there were certain things he did he did
14:46
differently because of a back injury and I remember as a kid thinking oh man he just a
14:52
foreign I'm thinking Uncle Bob was probably one of the toughest guys I knew
14:57
and so that's what I mean by disposition shift here's another example of a disposition shift
15:03
how many of you think Way Way Back how many of you thought when you had your children
15:08
this is a unique not unique it's a universal parental principle
15:14
you have your children and you said things interior maybe even exteriorly like I will never say the
15:21
things my father and my mother said to me these children are perfect there will be
15:26
no need for rules how many come on fess up we all did it and then pretty soon
15:32
there's there's the need for a rule and then there's a need for corporal
15:37
punishment and then you find yourself saying exactly what your father and your mother said
15:43
this is that disposition shift this is that movement we're all of an
15:48
age and an understanding that salvation is of the highest value it is the most prized
15:55
thing in all the universe but we're also dealing with children and grandchildren who have no recognition because they
16:03
don't recognize the peril you must recognize the Peril you must recognize the Eternal consequence in
16:10
order for salvation to have value and so that's a disposition shift that's what I'm talking about what are some other
16:16
disposition shifts how many of you have um a relative a child a niece a nephew
16:25
somebody within that first degree of consanguity if you don't know that term
16:31
it's within that first ring outside of the immediate family but still very very
16:36
close to you nieces nephews cousins first cousins these how many of you have one of those that is homosexual
16:44
all of us every single one of us and so to some degree so is your has your
16:52
disposition toward this changed it can't not change
16:57
be sure it doesn't change for the bad be sure it doesn't make you allow things
17:03
which are unclean into your into your heart into your soul
17:09
so resonance that we have to constantly keep our instrument calibrated our chalice if you will how do we do that we
17:16
do that by exercising a functional Catholic conscience what's a functional Catholic conscience
17:23
we have to constantly calibrate this instrument constantly calibrate the instrument so
17:29
that we can tell clean from unclean I put it in rural terms you got a built-in BS meter
17:37
listen to it and we as Catholics are that meter for
17:44
the culture this is not a position of popularity
17:53
it is not a position of popularity but we must do it nonetheless so as we talk about this a little bit
18:01
more this disposition I'm going to take a bit of a departure and so now we've got the string section playing let's go
18:07
over here or we've got the bass playing we've got that beat now let's go ahead
18:13
and add some some more to it what do we want to add to it let's insert the melody or overlay The
18:19
Melody of um Reclamation theology Reclamation theology is a term that we
18:27
use that says if you long for a time when the convents were full the
18:33
monasteries were full the churches were full and people were aware of their Catholic faith
18:39
then we've got to say what have we lost and how do we may not
18:44
regain it but how do we seek that disposition so I'll ask you very simply how many of you would like to have the
18:50
spiritual disposition of your ancestors that I want to show hands yeah we all
18:57
see that as something I'm not asking for the hardships I'm not asking you to give up toilet
19:02
paper I'm not asking what I'm asking is do you want the physical the spiritual
19:08
disposition of your ancestors will recognize that a lot of that is a result
19:14
of conforming yourself not only to nature but to the church and The rhythms
19:20
of the liturgy the understanding of the of the rhythms the natural rhythms and how God
19:27
communicates to us through those rhythms because we are human
19:32
women especially how many of you know are aware of the fact that in any given
19:40
area there are more babies born on the full moon how many you know that
19:45
how many of you know that there are also more of everything born on the full moon
19:52
why and we talk about lunatics what's a lunatic it's someone who has
19:59
trouble regulating or moderating their psychological state or their emotive
20:04
state in the full moon and it was seen as an indicator of diabolical presence why
20:11
do you suppose that is so here's why it is
20:19
the moon reflects the Sun the moon reflects the Brilliance of the sun the sun the the light of uncreated
20:27
day the Realms of uncreated day The Sun Shines no matter where the the Earth is
20:33
turned right it's a constant and it's a symbol of of God himself God
20:39
the father he in creation says let there be light and so this is the first attribute of
20:46
the Unseen God the Unseen God the god of thought
20:52
speaks and it is and then who is the word
20:57
Jesus so today we celebrate in the old liturgy today we celebrate saint Hillary
21:03
appointers called The Hammer of arianism what was arianism
21:09
it was the heresy that said that Jesus was created or it's a misuse of the term
21:17
begotten after creation
21:23
and so popes Bishops Emperors there was a majority of the
21:32
church that believed this and so we had Saint athanasius in the East Saint Hillary in the west that
21:39
wrote and talked about this and Hillary in the west said all you have to do is look at the
21:45
prologue of John's gospel in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and
21:50
nothing that came to be came to be without him we get one word in the Creed that explains this and it's called
21:56
consubstantial so when you when you hear that word in the Creed immediately think okay at one
22:04
point the hierarchy of the church was divided on this issue and this was a huge huge
22:10
issue why is it so important because our faith conforms to the Scripture it conforms to
22:18
the tradition it conforms to all of this if it's not in conformity now we've got a pattern break
22:26
and so the demon will exploit that pattern break so that's a pretty obvious example
22:32
everybody's everybody's on board with that so what if the example is contraception
22:38
70 percent of the Catholic Church believes that contraception is permissible
22:43
and the church says it is not So You're vulnerable in that area
22:52
the church says and not because the church made it up it's because it's scripturally based one of our doctrines
22:58
and dogmas is the four sins that cry out from the earth number one is the murder
23:03
of the innocent number two is sodomy there is a huge movement in our church
23:09
that says sodomy is okay do you see where I'm going with this
23:15
so this is not spiritual negotiation spiritual detaunt spiritual discussion
23:21
it's not can we all get along theology this is hand-to-hoof combat
23:26
and you're going to be vulnerable to the extent that you're outside that flow of
23:32
grace through the church we're going to talk about how Grace Flows but disposition helps back to the full
23:39
moon it's a reflection of the Sun so the reason the Diabolical are active during
23:44
the full moon is it is they get no break there's no Darkness
23:50
and so they get no break they're in the presence of the Sun during the day which they try to avoid most evil is at
23:57
night and then on the full moon God is reflected
24:04
this is one of the reasons that Mary and the moon are synonymous are not
24:10
synonymous but they're linked Mary is a symbol of the reflecting the Brilliance of God
24:16
who was created to do that the creature Lucifer was created to reflect the Brilliance of
24:22
God into all the universe and so the prince of light becomes the Prince of Darkness when he falls that's the
24:29
inversion that father mentioned so see the inversion people always ask us father and I to develop or give a talk
24:37
on the occult we want to know all the flavors of evil we want to know all the new practices
24:43
all the new things all the things going on first of all the moment we developed
24:49
that talk it's obsolete because it's moving it's constantly
24:54
shifting what is constant is our faith to know that everything they do is a
25:00
counterfeit of the sacraments of devotion of right relationship of the
25:06
constructs that convey Grace every one of those is a counterfeit that the demon does
25:13
how do you how do you uh of course today in digital banking it's much much different but how many of you remember
25:19
those days when the teller would go through that currency at an unbelievable
25:24
rate and they were the ones who spotted the counterfeits how
25:30
because it didn't feel right it didn't there was something about it
25:35
and if you've ever seen a teller an old school teller running through those and then every once in a while a bill would
25:41
go to the side how many of you ever shut crawfish
25:48
same thing how many of you ever vegetables you're going through the vegetables and one's one's not clean to
25:54
the side it's the same concept but we've got to know our faith so well you can't
26:00
Chuck a cold crawfish or a bad tomato unless you know what a good one is
26:05
and everything is compared against the good one against that which has Integrity has truth has resonance
26:14
and so we're too quick to uh accept unclean are things with small spot
26:20
if you've got a mountain of good tomatoes do you notice that your culling criteria
26:25
is a little bit stricter than if you got a half a dozen so if you got a half a dozen and you're
26:31
needing to make some type of Roux or something that saw something that needs tomatoes and you only got a half a dozen
26:37
you may be willing to put that one in there cut that little spot out
26:42
this is the way we're taking in spiritual information this is the way we're taking in our
26:48
faith is we've got to be strict and we've got to be able to tell clean from unclean that resonance quality is what
26:55
I'm talking about because the demon doesn't come at you with all with with total lie
27:00
it's going to be 90 truth or 90 even 99 truth there's that one little piece
27:06
that's off because he's not trying to drive you to hell
27:11
he's just trying to prevent you from getting gaining heaven
27:16
that's what he's about so back to the Moon
27:21
the phases the natural rhythms something's happening right now
27:27
um Daylight's getting longer have you started to perceive it
27:33
a little bit we lose it when we're not touching that agrarian lifestyle we're not touch when
27:40
we're not aware of it this is why nature is so recreational recreational is that
27:47
it puts us back in touch to some extent with The Agrarian rhythms The rhythms of the world The rhythms of that around us
27:54
and then let's overlay the spiritual rhythms so for instance a good example
28:01
there's a reason why these things happen there is a cosmic ordering now I'm going to use Cosmic
28:07
it's not a new age term It's actually an ancient Catholic term and so they
28:13
talk about the fathers talk about God brings Cosmos out of chaos order out of
28:20
disorder so the creation of the universe and the existence of the universe and all of us is a is a form of
28:27
Cosmos order Universal order but we're subject to the law if you will
28:35
of entropy does everybody know what I'm talking about in entropy are you aging
28:42
entropy if you leave a piece of metal outside does it rust
28:48
entropy it means that now there is a degradation there's a default of
28:53
degradation and Corruption because of the Fall it wasn't created that way
28:59
but because of sin because of the consequences of sin death and destruction visits the world these are
29:05
the wages of sin sin being that ruptured relationship with God
29:10
so the cosmos is altered by the free
29:15
will act of a creature so for instance when God creates the heavens and the
29:22
Earth he creates the heavens burst he creates the Angelic realm and all the celestial bodies first
29:29
then when Lucifer Rejects and says I will not serve
29:34
then a couple of things happen the first one is we get the first
29:39
exorcistic Formula and all exorcisms private are public follow this exact
29:46
same formula what is that formula so here it is in iconic form and in some
29:51
places it's even how many of you have seen the depiction of the sword on the
29:56
tongue of the devil this one's the most most accurate depiction so what's going on in that
30:02
iconic iconography so we're going to go again we're still in the Prelude we're going to go into
30:08
the choirs of Angels the hierarchies of angels how they're configured to
30:13
maximize and augment the flow of Grace into creation
30:19
but Lucifer is arguably the most magnificent creature he was the one of the closest to God
30:26
created to reflect God's Brilliance and Essence into all the cosmos the light
30:32
bearer and so God reveals to him
30:37
now where is all this coming from I'm pulling on tradition I'm pulling on the writings of Saint Thomas dionatious and
30:45
the settled understanding of angels uh within the church if you want to go
30:50
deeper into that all the footnotes everything else would be found in Father ripperger's book Dominion
30:57
um but that so what I'm saying is not made up it's consistent with all of this
31:04
and then what I'm telling you with regard to experience is we see this play out over and over
31:09
so to give you an idea father ripperger is in direct contact with the Diabolical for about 400 hours a year through
31:16
solemn session and through exorcisms and we're present we will I will filter
31:23
between three thousand and four thousand possible cases of extraordinary diabolical activity every year we've
31:30
been doing that about 15 years so there's just a simple the there's simply a huge data set so you get
31:36
patterns you get statistics out of this you get this continuity so when I'm speaking about this that's where this is
31:42
coming from and so again I I have no opinion and I'm not telling you this because I think
31:47
that's the way it ought to be or I read it and there's no experience behind it
31:52
so wisdom is knowledge with a bruise
31:58
so what I'm giving you is the wisdom of having watched by the ripperger and assisted him do this for all these years
32:05
um where was I oh back to the fall so Lucifer says God shows them the
32:14
Incarnation now this is a key part of the Aryan heresy and it's a key part uh this is a Protestant fallacy so I want
32:21
to ask you something this is testing resonance we're going to test your Catholic uh instrument your conscience
32:27
your resonance and even if you're not Catholic even if you're a new convert I
32:34
want you to listen and and to the interior movement when I make certain statements
32:40
how many of you believe that Jesus was created because of
32:47
Lucifer's fall how many believe that excellent because this is a major Point of
32:55
Departure between the protest and understanding of faith and and the way that they are diminishing the second
33:01
person of the Trinity which is Jesus the real presence when I say the real
33:07
presence understand that that precedes the Eucharist
33:14
what do I mean by that Jesus is the real presence of God the tangible presence of
33:19
God in the world and he's first tangible in the word
33:25
the spoken word has tangibility that's resonance
33:30
there has to be something tangible even though we can't see it there's a sound wave that's going from here to there
33:36
that's activating that vessel on the back in response to this vessel in the front does that make sense
33:43
and so if you understand resonance and how that works then you understand one
33:48
of the ways that actual Grace works so if we all are in agreement or we all
33:54
Ascent to the universal truth that is stated in John's gospel in the beginning
34:00
was the word and the Word was with God pivotal statement the Word was God
34:07
and so this idea of Jesus the second person of the Trinity
34:14
Trinity condescending demand because of Lucifer's response is faulty theology
34:21
that's not pure theology everybody good good so Lucifer says I will not serve
34:29
and the addendum or the continuation is I will not serve a God who will take a
34:34
form less than I you see that
34:41
Okay so I will not serve a God who will take a
34:46
form less than I that's a luciferian statement it's the first statement of a creature
34:53
that is uh it is a tangible Act of a creature against the holy will of God
35:00
has just made creation he has now shown the Angels the Incarnation
35:07
so something is pinging in my head and so I gotta I gotta address it how many of you hear the line in the exaltet written by
35:14
August Saint Augustine oh happy fault okay so oh happy fault
35:21
that we should get a savior this is the redeeming mission of Christ not the existence of Christ
35:28
okay so to differentiate between the two everybody good sorry about that a little little
35:35
departure but this is how that line fits into all of theology this is how you
35:40
bring it back into harmony with the symphony that we're we're experiencing so
35:46
Lucifer makes this statement I will not serve a God who will take a form less than I
35:53
there's a voice a smaller voice a smaller creature in fact Lucifer is of the highest hierarchy Michael is of the
36:00
lowest hierarchy second lowest choir and he says something
36:07
that is the sword of Saint Michael his statement is Deus who can compare to
36:14
God this very simple statement of absolute truth this rhetorical question who can
36:20
compare to God this is the exorcistic formula
36:26
this truth all demons if exorcism is defined as the driving of a fallen angel from a place
36:34
or from a person then this is the exorcistic formula it's
36:39
all done by invoking Christ yes Father
36:48
precisely so that in fact is his name so if you are a Michael in Hebrew your name is
36:55
Mikhail and the translation in Latin is quiet deos and in English is who can compare
37:02
to God that's your name
37:07
the El on the end is God and so in Hebrew Mikhail who can compare to God in
37:15
Latin deos who can compare to God and so this is he's named for his
37:21
statement he's known by his statement and in those pictures where that sword
37:26
the sword is the word and it is on the tongue the offending
37:32
member of Lucifer and he's depicted as a dragon or his grotesque as a grotesque
37:39
creature because his appearance is inverted now
37:45
he's created as the prince of light he becomes the Prince of Darkness and so his appearance is altered
37:52
requisite with his sin and so he becomes grotesque
37:58
so in that moment by the statement his own statement he is excommunicated
38:06
exercised driven out of the presence of the Holy and that's the important part
38:12
he's driven Out of Heaven so we picked this story up in um in um
38:19
John's apocalypse 12th chapter and a woman appeared in the sky
38:24
so again we have the celestial imagery and in response to the woman
38:31
to give birth to the child the dragon thrashes in the sky and his
38:37
tail sweeps a third of the stars from the sky how many of you remember this part
38:43
so the church fathers John is saying and describing and the church fathers are describing the fall of Lucifer
38:50
who when he has expelled from Heaven rushes to heaven to devour us
38:56
to devour all of humanity but the third of the Stars swept from
39:01
the sky this is the fall of the Angels which became demons Saint Thomas says that there is a two
39:10
operative principles at work one is called prelation and the other one is called
39:15
um a symmetry symmetry spiritual symmetry where if you say that
39:21
a third of the Angels fell then you can infer and rightly so that a third of all
39:28
Angels fell follow that logic so if a third of the seraphim fell a
39:33
third of the cherubim fell a third of the thrones all the way down the line so a third of all fell
39:40
as a result of the free will act of of Lucifer who makes this statement and does the equivalent of who's with me
39:48
in the thrashing of the tail and a third of the Demons follow him then
39:54
we've got this void in the in the heavens we've got this void
40:00
and so prolation must be satisfied the ranking the representative ranking of
40:07
creation must be satisfied so what does God do
40:13
God created the heavens complete and now they are marred by the free will act of
40:18
a creature so what does what is God's response to
40:24
that
40:29
got to fill it up you got to fill that void what does he fill the void with
40:36
us Church triumphant and so the very mud men which Lucifer
40:43
hate now occupy this place in the church triumphant
40:49
are you starting to see some of the visceral animosity now between humans and demons
40:57
they hate your guts individually and collectively
41:02
so this same understanding this same hatred is going to be manifest over and over
41:10
and over again do you see this same hatred in animosity and Isaac and Ishmael
41:16
do you see it you see it visited on Humanity do you do you see it visited on
41:24
us and everyone else who is not Catholic
41:29
so that that division Jesus himself says I come not to unite
41:36
but to divide this is the 18th chapter of Matthew I come with a sword what is the sword
41:43
Jesus comes with the truth the word
41:49
and so you'll either yield to it or you will not yield to it you'll yield to it in its totality not in its partiality in
41:56
its totality it's where the resonance is it's where the protection is so how do we Foster that so Reclamation
42:03
theology says we pick up these images we pick up this movement now
42:08
Theology and liturgy has been purposely deformed when you start to realize that you start
42:14
to recognize that you find yourself on a battlefield without constant lines of supply
42:21
you find yourself cut off from Grace you find yourself Grace is intermittent it
42:26
doesn't flow like it used to communication doesn't flow like it used to and so we are cut off from our supply
42:33
lines or Supply as much impeded
42:39
and so it's it's as if you've got a Cadre of of uh
42:45
Warriors of soldiers infantry soldiers we're in the jungle or the desert you
42:50
can pick the topography you want but we're cut off from supply lines and we used to get supplies
42:57
many of you have ever been in the in the military MREs C rations
43:03
these things are not built for Epicurean Delight
43:11
there is no such thing as etouffee in an MRE
43:17
but what they are is they're exactly the calories you need to discharge your mission
43:22
this is sacrament it is that it is what you need to discharge your mission when you need it
43:28
and it's there if the quartermaster is doing his job supplies doing their job
43:34
these things are there when you need them that is way different than running an army that once ever once a week you're
43:41
going to get a ton of Hershey bars do you see the difference
43:48
and so the old the the traditional liturgy and understanding was built up
43:53
over the centuries to provide this constant nourishment in light of what was happening
43:59
um in the in the season so I'll give you an example we lost all the octaves
44:06
we're down to just one octave left and this was methodical so um I'm going to give you a website at
44:13
the end of the day but we're doing some Daily Reflections called uh Reclamation theology is anybody in here listening to
44:19
them excellent they're about a 15 minute reflection so for instance I'll and I'll
44:25
summarize what's happening this past week we had holy family in the traditional
44:31
form we had Holy Family on Sunday having had Epiphany on Friday so we have Epiphany then we have the
44:38
vigil of the Holy Family then we have Holy Family on Sunday so you see the natural progression Epiphany and now
44:45
we're starting to move into the world we're ready to leave Bethlehem he's been recognized by
44:51
um the Magi eight days after he's born and so there's this this movement
44:57
and so we celebrate his circumcision then we celebrate the Epiphany and now he's
45:04
ready to move and so there's this progression so then we have Holy Family following holy family we have three days
45:10
all through the week is what's called theria days meaning we go back to the
45:17
reading of the previous Sunday and we want to use these very days as a tritum of three-day
45:23
observation and it's the same readings however the focal point is that we get
45:32
um we get Jesus in the temple we get his obedience
45:38
we get this movement toward Friday and on Friday we celebrate or memorialize
45:44
the baptism of Our Lord so now there's this movement and so all kinds of things
45:49
are happening so in this week he goes from leaving Bethlehem now starting out
45:55
into the world now he's baptized he was baptized yesterday in that traditional liturgy so you see this movement you
46:02
also see that Saint Joseph is with us on Sunday he's with us on Monday but by Friday you know Saint Joseph
46:09
the tradition is Saint Joseph died sometime in that movement of maturity
46:16
from holy family from Epiphany he's there he's there to plight of Egypt he's
46:21
there to return he's there with him in in Nazareth and then by the baptism
46:27
Saint Joseph has passed away what else is happening
46:32
so today is the Saturday following the baptism and what we will have tomorrow
46:37
is the wedding at Cana so what's happening in between sat on that Saturday the Temptation in
46:44
the desert Christ is baptized immediately one gospel account says he's driven into the desert one gospel
46:51
account says he's led into the desert it is exactly the same for us we are
46:57
either driven into spiritual warfare or we're led into it what's our interior disposition
47:03
do we talk about attack I'm under attack or we talk about I'm under formation I'm under opportunity
47:11
if you're going to be a warrior and this is all militaristic language we're the
47:16
church militant not the church hanging out not the church reticent not the church chillin
47:21
not the church wanting to get along where the church militant and so it must be we must be about this
47:28
action and so when it says he's led into the desert this is the the person who volunteers
47:34
for military service when it says he is driven into the desert this is the person who is conscripted into military
47:41
service either way you're in the desert you're in it
47:48
you you can't sit this one out there is no spiritual candidate to which you can flee
47:55
you know the reference many in in uh in the Vietnam era fled to
48:00
Canada to to escape conscription the point is
48:07
either way you're in it you're in it whether you want to be or not so Saturday
48:14
in the desert what else is Saturday
48:20
exactly who said that thanks be to God four gold stars Mary Saturday Saturday is Mary's day
48:27
because there are two very very explicit times actually three but they're and
48:34
we'll talk about all three of them how about that but there are times when Jesus and Mary are separated
48:42
first time on the way back that was Saturday
48:48
a week ago on the way back from Jerusalem and this leads us to the holy family in the
48:54
reading where they find him in the temple so Saturday is a day of separation for Mary and Jesus first
49:00
separation is the temple second separation Temptation in the desert
49:06
what is the third separation Holy Saturday when he's in the Tomb
49:14
Holy Saturday when he's in the Tomb so these are the three poignant times when our blessed mother so from here on for
49:21
the rest of and Saturday you're here for the rest of your life if you'll remember it's Saturday
49:28
Saturday if we just remember on on The Saturdays these are the times that Mary was
49:34
separated from Jesus these are the times that Jesus is in direct conflict or in direct contact
49:42
with the devil two of those three times one when he descends to hell
49:48
and the saints come marching in that's the Saturday Holy Saturday but but the
49:54
demon is aware of these rhythms and these movements whether you are or not
50:00
and so that's an example as we're moving in it isn't it interesting that Saint
50:05
Hilary of pointers is today because he was talking about who he
50:12
really is the same conversations going on in the desert the demon is trying to figure out
50:19
is he the Christ Lucifer doesn't know him personally
50:25
he knows him conceptually and so this is the Temptation in the desert
50:31
do you see how this overlay is you can't make this stuff up it is so rich no matter which way you compress it
50:37
which way you fold it it is the tapestry of Truth and salvation history and the golden thread Runs Through It no matter
50:44
which way you fold it it's always there and that's the resonance that I'm talking about so if you're seeking that
50:50
resonance get in touch with our liturgy and don't do it from a standpoint of of denigrating the ordinary form
50:58
people are always some of the the trades some of the traditional traditionalists
51:04
are chafe under this form I think it's now properly named it is the extraordinary form of the
51:11
Liturgy it is extraordinary and we're living in a very ordinary time and we
51:16
need the extraordinary even if you're going to the new liturgy it doesn't prevent you from getting in touch with
51:23
historically what were these celebrations I'm not saying anything about the validity of the mass please
51:29
understand I'm not saying anything about against the validity of the new Mass it's not where I'm going with this what
51:36
I'm saying is there's a very very rich underpending and tradition that we do
51:42
well to be in touch with and it and it helps us with the resonance what what resonates what doesn't resonate what is
51:48
consistent with our faith does that make sense okay so let's go to this first image
51:59
and so this right here is [Music] um let me explain it a little bit so this
52:06
first image is the what's called The athenations Shield and so athanasius was the same in the
52:13
east at the same time Hillary was in the west and they were saying the same thing it was the unity of the Trinity the
52:19
Trinity and unity and the functional theology with regard to Trinity now one
52:25
of the things the demon wants to do if he can't get you not to if you're
52:31
Resolute about going to church about seeking your faith then what he's after is that one degree departure
52:39
a little bit of misunderstanding so
52:44
the trinity in unity has been under attack and is under constant attack because it is a central point of our
52:51
faith so the Potter the Father the way you read this is the Father the Son and
52:56
the Holy Ghost the father is referring to God the Creator
53:03
God the son and God the the Holy Ghost our Holy Spirit and so what you're
53:08
looking at is the son is not the father but the son is God you see how to read
53:14
the schema and then it repeats the sun is not the spirit but the spirit is God
53:21
so this in in this uh scheme of form gives you an idea to listen very
53:28
carefully how many of you have heard our Protestant Brethren say um Jesus is the son of God
53:38
they're not willing to say Jesus is God how many of you've heard this and noticed this all right so there's a lack
53:44
of residence that resonance there's a Discord there and that is the Aryan
53:50
heresy that's what they're promulgating and so in answer to that like Hillary
53:57
says you go to the prologue of John's gospel and this thing is complete now there's a couple of overlays with regard
54:03
to this in the confederior we can we confess sins of
54:10
thought word deed now let's overlay that
54:16
the Unseen God of thought speaks is the god of word and it's perpetuated
54:24
as The Advocate the god of deed thought word deed you see it
54:30
now let's overlay faith hope and charity faith in God the father becomes hope in
54:37
Christ the son and is perfected in the charity of the Holy Spirit you see it
54:44
and so this is like adding musical track on top of musical tracks the demon doesn't want you to see this
54:51
he wants you to divide this stuff so the first theological virtue the
54:57
first infused virtue is what faith faith in
55:03
God the father so see the persons of the trinity in those theological virtues in
55:09
those infused virtues and see that one leads to the other sequentially
55:15
so if I have operative scripture study if I have
55:23
faith but I do not have works
55:28
what's my state incomplete What's missing
55:36
correct what if I have a personal relationship with my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
55:47
correct so when we go to confession and we confess our sins
55:52
what are we doing who are we confessing first of all who are we confessing to up
55:58
here nope trick question alert I should have put the
56:04
we're confessing to the priest in Persona christe
56:11
in order to be reconciled to God the Father for what purpose
56:18
that we may act in charity what is the primary OBEX to charity
56:26
lack of forgiveness lack of forgiveness this is the number one retained sin
56:33
I like you but I don't like you is that a Catholic statement no and who does it sound like
56:40
I'll serve God in you but not in you it is a luciferian statement so anytime
56:47
we say I'm willing to see God in these people but not in these people
56:54
because the charity has to be perfected it has to be open to all this is our
57:00
Lord saying be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect what does he mean by that being perfect
57:07
as your heavenly father is perfect to be consistent to be the same because he clarifies a statement when he says The
57:14
Sun Shines on the just and the unjust the rain falls on the wicked and the good
57:19
and so he's saying God the father is present and desirous of salvation for
57:24
all because he created all now the others some may not be in
57:30
Conformity to his will and let me this is another thing that the demon wants to do and he's quite
57:37
good at it modernly we have done anthropomorphic projection upon God what
57:43
does that mean we've given him and talked about him in human attribute the
57:48
only the only member of the Trinity with human attribute is he who was in human
57:54
form and his human attributes are perfected
58:01
so God the Father does not want he doesn't desire he doesn't plan he
58:08
doesn't you see where I'm going he Wills Deus Vault he Wills God Wills
58:16
what does he will his will always and everywhere is Union
58:22
creation is a function of Union because he creates Us by extending himself
58:28
by becoming tangible by becoming manifest and so this is created it being created
58:35
in the image and likeness of God if we're created in the image and likeness of God don't you wish you had
58:41
an owner's manual for the soul you do it's called the Baltimore catechism
58:47
what is the first line what is our purpose
58:52
so read it like a label this is the first this is the first line in your
58:58
label and if you are engaged in off-label use warranties do not apply
59:07
what are the warranties if you're used for the purpose
59:13
we're going to go back and forth to the sixth chapter of John's gospel if you eat my flesh and drink my blood
59:20
you shall have life Everlasting that's one of the stipulations correct
59:26
he doesn't say or Plan B so off-label use takes us out of
59:33
warranty it takes us out of right communication it takes us out of the flow of Grace and
59:41
so this concept of off-label use is a very very important concept why was I created
59:49
Baltimore catechism has these answers it's very very simple
59:57
precisely and so that's the first line in your label and if you're not
1:00:03
doing that you're already out of warranty you're already being used for a purpose for which you were not made
1:00:11
and again God Wills God doesn't want God doesn't plan God
1:00:16
take out that anthropomorphic projection and realize that God Wills the fact that
1:00:21
you are here is an example of God's will he willed your existence and then the last concept I'm going to
1:00:28
leave you with until we go to questions the last concept I want to leave you with in this first section of this talk
1:00:34
is let's talk about how he Wills your existence
1:00:40
God does nothing randomly so let's go through a series of
1:00:46
statements because what the demon will do is he will start with a premise
1:00:51
either a true or a false premise and then he will develop that premise but eventually he will skew off into a
1:00:58
falsehood so consistent with our with our faith um
1:01:04
is anyone in opposition and let's parse this out is anyone in opposition to the
1:01:10
statement God does nothing randomly everything has a purpose
1:01:17
if everything has a purpose then that purpose is going to be consistent with his holy will everybody's still with me
1:01:24
if at any point we start to depart please raise your hand and and because they're going to be other people having
1:01:30
the same interior um resistance so don't be not afraid
1:01:38
what is his will his will always and everywhere is Union after the fall Union is salvation
1:01:46
so he just is uh he Wills the salvation of all he creates everybody good with
1:01:54
that anybody having a thought about a word called predestination
1:01:59
if they are we'll cycle back around to it because Catholic predestination is much different than Wesleyan or Calvin's
1:02:06
predestination so predestination is that heaven is denied
1:02:12
to none and they flipped it and said predestination is limited to some
1:02:18
that makes sense now when I say denied to none that doesn't mean that doesn't
1:02:24
mean that everybody goes to heaven that's another error but when it's
1:02:29
denied To None no one's created for the purpose of damnation everyone's created for the purpose of
1:02:35
Union that's the that's the straight theology Catholic theology on it okay everybody's
1:02:40
still with me on this premise so number four is is if we're moving
1:02:47
down this line of this premise then if God does nothing randomly everything is for the purpose of Salvation everything
1:02:53
is conformable with his will then let's talk about the particulars of your existence because he chose those he
1:03:02
chose the ethnicity the culture the gender the time in
1:03:07
history he chose everything about the conception to send your soul
1:03:16
everybody's still with me how mind-blowing is that how Illuminating is
1:03:23
that and then you get an idea of how the demon first starts to attack identity all of us have heard variations on the
1:03:30
LIE now this is the wrong family for you these people don't understand you these people don't appreciate you am I the
1:03:37
only one that ever heard those lies all of us and if you bite now we've got now
1:03:43
he's established a relationship with you based upon a problem with your
1:03:48
relationship with God the Father this is the the this is the relationship
1:03:55
that he has to fracture if he's going to take you out of the flow of Grace
1:04:01
that's the relationship he has to fracture that he has to militate against if he's going to take you out of the
1:04:06
flow of Grace is to have a problem with God the Father ultimately and he does that very
1:04:13
methodically and we'll talk about that as we go deeper into this grace chart but I'm going to stop now and ask we'll
1:04:19
we'll have questions until 10 15 and then we'll have some time to prepare for Mass
1:04:30
yesterday you explained it well yeah the demon or the Demonic lines just one
1:04:37
little crack one percent off say it's contraceptive
1:04:42
it may start out and explain it well yesterday one percent but by the time it gets later on in life it's it's half
1:04:48
right right so in order to fracture our faith in God the Father they'll use one of
1:04:56
those how does can you explain a little bit how that kind of comes into playing yep so this will give you some look in
1:05:04
into the next section is the author of all Grace is God the Father
1:05:10
but it flows through the constructs of Christ the Sun every drop of Grace flows
1:05:16
through the sacrifice on Calvary then it flows through Sacrament Grace
1:05:21
the grace of the Sacrament in the church and we can start to occlude or impede
1:05:26
the grace that flows through the sacrament if we do not Ascend fully to the doctrines and dogmas of the church
1:05:32
it doesn't mean we have to explain them we have to understand them intellectually you have to assent to
1:05:37
them you have to order your life to them
1:05:44
right so then your your grace is being impeded
1:05:49
precisely okay and instead and it's that um
1:05:56
it's that stumbling block is preventing and it's going to probably leak over into other things right so to
1:06:02
what Saint Thomas is is that OBEX now will darken your intellect in other
1:06:07
areas so you'll fail to see you'll fail to receive the illumination of Grace in
1:06:13
other areas so your ability to make good decisions in that area and then the areas that spread from it are
1:06:19
accentuated okay so and you haven't got to it yet but not to
1:06:25
overreach your own step that that Gap that they have for contraception how does everyone want to
1:06:32
know to point to that so to facilitate that so that it grows into something other than
1:06:38
so it's usually by our Behavior he's not reading thoughts it's by our behavior and so we're going to find and be
1:06:44
attracted to people who think the same way we think and so we're going to gather in our
1:06:50
conversation is going to to be indicative if not outright um aligned with it and so birds of a
1:06:58
feather flock together Saint um Leo the great Pope Leo the great talked about holy and Unholy alliances
1:07:06
as being one of the primary obexes to Grace and so you can it's not hard to
1:07:13
find these these individuals if the demon is about that
1:07:21
actually even a great Amendment right for the father doesn't speak to it moreover correct
1:07:27
so the demon is looking for what's called tacit approval this is the first level of acceptance of a Temptation if
1:07:34
you say something to me and I do not reject it then that's called tacit approval by my silence I have
1:07:41
um given a cent to the statement and so we we very we've elevated silence
1:07:49
to um we've we've misused it and so it's not the prudent silence and we we have
1:07:55
the ability to be adamantly silent and I didn't say anything so she knew what I meant no she did not
1:08:04
she did not if I stand on your toe and you don't oppose then I can't assume
1:08:09
it's okay to increase the pressure but that's exactly the way it works
1:08:16
tell me that same thing every every week now I gotta reject every week or I did the first time I say it um no
1:08:26
no so the the resoluteness with which you do it both interiorly and exteriorly
1:08:32
it will come up less and less and less until that that temptation is gone or
1:08:37
until that doubt is gone but it's a good question um it's not ever a one and done
1:08:46
um it you're going to be tempted in an area as long as you entertain it and so
1:08:51
um let's say for instance you're um you're going to find your predominant fault this is one of the things that
1:08:58
that's where all the activity is because he's an opportunist and there's a
1:09:03
concept called psychological compatibility that opens the relationship between you and any other
1:09:10
creature you have to have some psychological compatibility so for instance I'm going to ask you to
1:09:15
carry anything about chickens okay then we have no psychological
1:09:21
compatibility with about the keeping and raising of poultry so we don't have a common interest
1:09:26
and so if that is of utmost importance to me then we're not going to pursue a
1:09:33
relationship based on the keeping and raising of poultry you following me
1:09:38
now if I'm really interested in fostering a relationship with you then I may ask okay what are you interested in
1:09:45
and whatever that may be I'll either have an interest or I want but what the Diabolical does is let's let's suppose
1:09:52
your interest is race cars I got no interest in race cars but I got a buddy that does and I'm going to hook the two
1:09:57
of you guys up see how that works the demons are specific
1:10:09
he does no no no State his talk let's say whatever
1:10:14
who makes the call on the uh to make sure that the quote demon lines up so
1:10:19
this is this is part of the concert of free wills and if he's willing to first of all this
1:10:25
conversation if I'm diabolical we're already in a sinful context if he's practicing his faith it's no problem but
1:10:33
if it's in a bar on a weeknight and you should be home at then it's like every
1:10:38
bar is like the bar in Star Wars if you could see it from the spiritual aspect
1:10:44
because thereafter breaking vocation they're not after you individually
1:10:49
but you're going to be in a position of authority you're going to be in a line of authority you're going to be a husband you're going to be a wife you're
1:10:55
you're going to have strategic significance and so that's how the Demon's going to
1:11:01
use you is for your strategic significance
1:11:10
what you're describing then talking about fracture so you're moving away from the second
1:11:17
not practicing the play we all have family and friends good family and friends that walk away from
1:11:24
church was looser I mean uh with Luther the
1:11:30
ultimate fracture no I don't think we've seen the ultimate fracture it's coming
1:11:39
he is the downstairs fracture as you can have based on the way you've described
1:11:44
it well that's precise foreign
1:11:59
working awful hard today and I don't think a lot of them really know what they're doing
1:12:04
probably not let's go back because I want to make make a couple of points you bring up something so let's look at it
1:12:10
in a light of traditionalism in in a lot of universal spirituality so first of all Lucifer's formula for fracturing the
1:12:18
church is diabolically inspired um many many points of evidence to the
1:12:26
fact that he was in fact possessed people forget that this is a priest who drew a nun out of her vocation
1:12:34
so precisely he's a priest and he draws a nun out of her vocation and they're
1:12:40
engaged in behavior that is not requisite with their locations as religious all the time this is going on
1:12:46
but what he does the formula is classic what he does is he picks a point of
1:12:52
transgression of the church which is abuse of indulgences and
1:12:59
various other things and he picks that point of transgression
1:13:05
that will have an emotional appeal and then he immediately has a response
1:13:11
of those who are also damaged in their faith and willing to find problems with
1:13:17
authority I'll give you a classic example of how it works if I make the statement my
1:13:24
father beat me every day of my life you do you see the emotional response in
1:13:29
you how many of you felt that stir and you view me differently and you
1:13:36
don't even know him and you view him differently as less than incidentally my
1:13:42
father's a beautiful man and so it's it's an abject lie but what what loose
1:13:49
uh what Luther did was he took this bit of Truth and then constructed this black
1:13:56
pearl around it and people were mesmerized by the Black Pearl they had things against the church and so they
1:14:03
flocked to it this is the way protestantism starts now let's take back and get a bigger picture so in 10 in the
1:14:10
mid 1500s when Lucifer I mean when it's not a fraudian slip
1:14:19
when Luther does what he does and fractures the church and he takes 10
1:14:25
million Souls with him meanwhile across the ocean
1:14:30
Mary's appearing to Juan Diego now you see it in a bigger context
1:14:38
she brings 13 million in so don't mess with her
1:14:43
so in the cosmic body count Cosmic Soul count the Blessed Mother just thumps him
1:14:50
so the church actually increases as a result but we're we don't see that
1:15:05
so here's a it's a it's a wonderful question so there are nine ways to be
1:15:11
complacent in the Sin of another and so this is
1:15:17
falling out of this is in the same section that talks about the Spiritual Works of Mercy the corporate Works of
1:15:23
Mercy and the ways that we are complacent in the sins of others if you got a 1962 missile this is in there
1:15:30
incidentally if you can only own one book that's the book you need to own it's the prayers everything that is in
1:15:36
there is replete nothing's been abrogated out of that so to answer your
1:15:42
question if you follow the formula of the Spiritual Works of Mercy
1:15:48
number one traditionally is to counsel the doubtful number two is to to instruct the ignorant and number three
1:15:55
is to admonish The Sinner in some formula one and two are switched and and so it doesn't really matter what what
1:16:01
order you get them in but to talk to your family member the best thing to do is is to Simply say your position is
1:16:08
inconsistent with our fight and that's it you are not going to be
1:16:14
judged or find yourself complacent in their sin based on their behavior your
1:16:20
complacency in their sin is based on your behavior and so in the same way that the prophet
1:16:26
is not judged by whether the people change and yield to the message he's judged by whether he discharges the
1:16:32
message and so very simply um you you might speak to whoever it is
1:16:37
and say are you aware that even though by popular
1:16:42
um practice and other things this is not consistent with our faith are you aware of that and then you you've already gone
1:16:49
the first route and then if they say well I want to discuss that with you I don't believe that's right then all you do is told the truth told like a bell
1:16:56
which simply it's inconsistent with our faith
1:17:02
so you can't say it that way because only in in the Catholic church is that
1:17:10
still adhered to in its totality so one of the things that to realize is that prior to 1930 abortion was uh there
1:17:18
was a total ban on abortion with regard to to the Christian faith all all denominations everybody was against it
1:17:26
until we get Margaret Margaret Sanger who comes on the scene in the heights of the depression and now suddenly
1:17:32
something starts to become acceptable in various forms incidentally a lot of our
1:17:38
prayers are lost we we should pray to um Pope Pius IX Pope Pius IX in the
1:17:46
1840s gave us the definitive and spoken fallibly on this that life begins at
1:17:54
conception that there's no inanimate portion of fetal development and that's
1:18:00
the language you use there is no inanimate portion of fetal development and when
1:18:07
he's using the word animate he's meaning there's no part of human development that occurs without the soul being
1:18:12
present and that's the key part of the theology that's Pius IX and that is the
1:18:18
doctrine the Dogma infallible declaration that comes forward to today but we're not using his language we've
1:18:26
got to use his language and that is that the soul is present at the moment of conception we talk about human life as
1:18:32
present Pius IX was very very clear he said that life can't consid can he can't be
1:18:39
without the soul the Ergo the soul is there and it's there from conception at
1:18:45
the very first Union of sperm and egg at that moment a soul is dispensed and and
1:18:51
from God God sends a soul because that is the moment of conception and that was
1:18:56
back to what we were talking about God choosing the particulars of your uh you're coming into existence
1:19:10
it is a Dogma that capital punishment is allowed and the thing about it is is it
1:19:17
is done um so the fifth commandment Thou shalt not
1:19:22
kill we lose the understanding of that because what we want to do is we want to
1:19:28
immediately go to mitigating circumstances and we want to say it's not a violation
1:19:34
of the first commandment because I was authorized either by War by penal by the
1:19:41
imposition of penal penalty crime
1:19:46
or self-defense it's still the taking of a life
1:19:52
and so the the right discussion is who's culpable so it has to go to culpability so for
1:19:58
instance if I am in a and go to go through this with a Catholic theology
1:20:03
perspective is is very beneficial so let's walk through it um
1:20:09
someone breaks into a home and the man of the house kills this person this
1:20:16
intruder is that a violation of the fifth commandment
1:20:23
it is it is because you apply the law the decalogue
1:20:29
you apply it universally because it either is a taking of a life
1:20:34
or it is not a taking of a life now follow me through
1:20:41
who Bears the culpability for the life
1:20:46
in that case the man the Intruder Bears the culpability
1:21:02
he's precisely right think up to and include the lethal Force to do so that's precisely right that's
1:21:10
precisely right so what I'm saying is who Bears the culpability under that commandment so there's a culpability
1:21:16
there's a there's an answering for the life who answers for the life is he who
1:21:21
put his own life in jeopardy and so this is the understanding suicide for instance who answers for that life
1:21:28
the one who took the life do you see do you see the application applied and so that's the application
1:21:35
that carries over into just War it's the application that carries over into capital punishment that by their action
1:21:42
they've placed their life in a Jeopardy um and and so when you see it that way
1:21:48
you see that even the person the the criminal or the Intruder his life still has dignity his
1:21:54
life has the same amount of dignity and sacredness as does yours and so who answers for the taking of the
1:22:02
life is he who puts his life in those cases who who puts his life in jeopardy
1:22:08
correct that's what I'm saying and and so we go we want to try to mitigate the the
1:22:15
circumstance of the ACT not the consequence and so you have to go to in Catholic theology we have to say there
1:22:21
has to be that price has to be paid it has to be paid by somebody because that's Divine Justice he who created
1:22:28
life
1:22:34
correct so to understand suicide we're going to
1:22:39
get close I don't want to dodge the question but we're close to mass uh I don't want to dodge the question so
1:22:44
here's the question here's the answer with regard to Suicide um there was a large a large portion of
1:22:51
History where suicide was done specifically has an offense against God
1:22:57
and it's still done under that context most of the time we
1:23:03
see suicide as a as a as a result of a diminished mental
1:23:09
capacity or compromised psychological state but you got to understand there's a large amount of people in the world
1:23:15
are significant number of people in the world who take their own life in order to have stature in the afterlife that is
1:23:22
their belief and if they do it in light of of satanic
1:23:27
ritual and right they're attaining the the
1:23:32
the counterfeit of sainthood they're attaining what they think is a stature an increased stature on the other side
1:23:39
it's a it's a counterfeit of martyrdom all of sac still sacrifice all of these things and so that element of suicide's
1:23:46
still there um and for that that person is absolutely 100 culpable
1:23:53
but you have to understand that while God is is bound to the sacrament and
1:23:58
bound to uh theology he's not bound by it he created this soul and so there's a
1:24:05
moment in particular judgment between he and the Soul who took their own life if that soul is baptized if that soul is
1:24:12
catechized then that's a that's a moment between the Sacred Heart and that soul
1:24:18
that we can't begin to plumb we're not judging that and so you you do have the obligation as a family member and as
1:24:24
others to continue to pray for them um as in the hot in the hope that they are purgative
1:24:31
something I think all of these things come into
1:24:36
account we have to consider what is the diminishment of the mental capacity that led to uh the decision but we've got to
1:24:43
also realize that there are genuine Bad actors out there in the world and in the cosmos who are doing this as a direct
1:24:49
attack against God
1:25:10
can you hear me all right
1:25:18
you know how you get a Catholic crowd's attention
1:25:25
Lord we ask you to give us the words for each other the ears with which to hear them Lord Prosper the work of our hands
1:25:33
and the efforts of our hearts in Christ's most holy name Amen in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy
1:25:38
Ghost amen so we're back so we've got um
1:25:43
145 to 3 I'm going to stop uh about 2 30
1:25:49
2 40 uh so I'll go for about an hour and then we'll have questions and answers
1:25:54
and so this morning was essentially preliminary there were a couple of questions asked
1:26:00
in private that I want to address because I think they're they're there for everyone uh those questions and so
1:26:08
number one was um the understanding of the Angelic
1:26:13
Realm in regard to the the human realm or Humanity Angels vastly outnumber us
1:26:21
um and so the idea of a third falling and then making room for the church
1:26:27
triumphant that's not a one-to-one ratio and so their numbers are greater than
1:26:33
our numbers and so there's no limit to those Souls that can attain heaven or
1:26:41
room in heaven so to speak so um that's I will tell you this though is
1:26:48
that the traditional teaching of the Catholic church is that it's very difficult to gain heaven heaven is not
1:26:55
something to be guaranteed um it is something to be strived for this idea and we even have modernly
1:27:02
prelates that will tell you that hell is empty hell is not empty um the idea that God
1:27:09
um is a merciful god and defining that as taking everyone God will not operate
1:27:16
in opposition to your free will if it is in opposition to his will so trick
1:27:22
question alert what is the most operative force in the universe human will or God's will
1:27:30
human will I didn't say what is the most powerful what is the most operative
1:27:36
and so God honors our free will or our will even when we use it to our own detriment
1:27:44
and so when you ask the question why does God allow
1:27:50
do you see how that's a non-sequitur question so for the abused person to say how does
1:27:56
God allow you abuse and evil this is occurring
1:28:02
because of the Free Will of a creature remember that the cosmos were originally marred because of the Free Will apostasy
1:28:09
or rebellion of Lucifer so this understanding of of what God
1:28:15
does God Wills Union and then if we will union now we're in Conformity of Wills
1:28:21
do you see that so when someone abuses another person
1:28:26
physically psychologically spiritually what is abuse
1:28:33
what is what is the definition of abuse it's a misuse of will
1:28:40
and it's imposed upon others do you see how that works and so this is not something for God to
1:28:46
allow it simply occurs is it consistent with God's will
1:28:53
absolutely not and that's the definition of abuse is a relational quality that is in
1:28:59
opposition to God's holy will which is salvation which is Charity right relationship the Desiring of the good
1:29:06
for another do you see how that works
1:29:12
and that takes us into that off-label use we were talking about
1:29:17
does that make sense so we were made for charity we were made for love we were
1:29:22
made for Union with God we were made for conforming our will to his holy will and
1:29:27
when we do not do those things now we're vulnerable to the adversary that's when the adversary uh is present
1:29:34
to us that presence is based that relationship with the with the adversary with the
1:29:41
Diabolical is because of psychological compatibility meaning our psychology has
1:29:47
now fallen their psychology Has Fallen and our fallen Natures now communicate
1:29:54
with each other because we're speaking the language of sin not the language of charity
1:30:01
not the language of love makes sense okay so let's talk for a moment about
1:30:08
finish this diagram this particular diagram talks about the flow of Grace
1:30:14
and so some understanding of Grace from a Catholic perspective
1:30:19
um so Grace can be differentiated into three types in Catholic in in theology
1:30:25
in in Catholic understanding those three types are number one actual Grace easy
1:30:31
way to remember it it is the grace to act actual Grace
1:30:37
actual Grace is the medium of conversation between creature and
1:30:43
creator so who's eligible just this is applied
1:30:48
theology who's eligible for actual Grace
1:30:54
everyone precisely the only people not are those that are not creatures any non-creatures here
1:31:00
let me ask it another way anybody here who isn't a son or a daughter okay great we're we're a group of
1:31:06
creatures so all of us have access to actual Grace this is the medium of
1:31:13
communication between creature and Creator Saint Thomas calls this the parameters of this communication he
1:31:19
calls this the natural law how many of you've heard this it is the natural law and so there are
1:31:26
things that we don't have to be taught we don't have to be taught that it's
1:31:32
wrong to kill there's no culture where that is uh
1:31:40
acceptable there are all mitigations
1:31:45
do you understand what I'm getting at in order to even in a cannibalistic culture there is a sense that something
1:31:53
else precedes that sin what do I mean by that all the
1:31:59
cannibalistic cultures saw the other people they were eating as less than themselves who does that sound like
1:32:05
Lucifer remember I won't serve a God who will take a form less than I
1:32:10
and and so you can apply these principles you can cross-reference these principles and you see what I mean so
1:32:15
this natural law is the parameters of communication it's the vocabulary and
1:32:20
grammar if you will of actual Grace if actual Grace is a communication
1:32:26
and it's going to be a rudimentary form our Lord talks about this when he's in
1:32:33
the in the Gospel of John and he says he gives the following formula
1:32:38
for Grace he says no one comes to the father unless the father beckons do you
1:32:44
remember this scripture no one comes to the father unless the father beckons
1:32:51
beckoning is actual Grace it is the desire for something Beyond
1:32:57
ourselves and even in cultures that don't know how to articulate that as God there's still
1:33:04
the desire that is there this is why some peoples are much easier
1:33:09
to missionize than others when the missionaries encountered the Native Americans they were of one of two
1:33:16
uh flavors or dispositions if you will those who recognized a benevolent great
1:33:23
spirit and those who recognized a malevolent
1:33:28
great spirit those who recognized a benevolent great spirit saw in the missionaries message
1:33:34
the fullness of truth that the great spirit the man the benevolent great spirit who cared for them and loved them
1:33:41
and was kind to them and provided for them was in fact God almighty
1:33:47
they were very easily missionized do you see that those that were diabolically uh
1:33:53
influenced who believed in a malevolent great spirit a vengeful God these were the ones that
1:33:59
kept slaves and and visited mutilating atrocities on their victims and these
1:34:05
kind of things they're literally Savages they did not respond in the same way to
1:34:11
the same message because they didn't have that disposition their image of God was different they're
1:34:19
still under the influence of actual Grace there's still a communication but that
1:34:25
communication is skewed through the Diabolical instead of being purified through the Angelic
1:34:34
so when you see it that way Jesus still speaking no one comes to the
1:34:39
father unless the father beckons what's his next line and no one comes to the
1:34:45
father unless he comes through me Jesus speaking
1:34:51
so this tells us that the only way to access God the
1:34:56
Father purely is through Christ
1:35:04
do you hear that and so no one the beckoning
1:35:10
God the father is present through the Holy Spirit and the natural law to the
1:35:15
creature the anime what animates us but we have to come through Christ
1:35:22
and no one comes to the father unless he comes through me Jesus speaking
1:35:27
so this brings us to the second part of Grace or the second type of Grace and
1:35:34
this is the grace of the sacrament wouldn't we use the term sacramental
1:35:40
Grace that's in inadequate
1:35:45
sacramental is a is a diminution or a diminutive form of sacrament
1:35:52
so that the grace that flows through the sacrament is the grace that enables you
1:36:00
to make good on whatever it is you're stationed in life your vocation
1:36:06
that's what it does is it enables you to act in a in a way to dispense Grace
1:36:15
only now can you be a conduit of Grace and the two conduits through which all
1:36:21
Grace Flows are the vocations of marriage and
1:36:26
religious life those that's where Grace Flows
1:36:31
both of those are forms of sacramental theology uh sacrificial theology because it's a giving of ourselves back to God
1:36:39
and availing ourselves giving ourselves to God in such a way as that we now can convey Grace everybody with me so far
1:36:47
all right so this is why you see there's a call to Holiness that is beyond the
1:36:55
beckoning the call to God the Father so there's this desire those of you who
1:37:01
are converts first of all there's a realization that there's something more
1:37:08
so the conversion experience is not unique to someone outside the Catholic faith it should be ongoing to us in the
1:37:16
Catholic faith there's a constant conversion of all of those elements in us and in our life that are unconverted
1:37:23
that are yet to be given over to God but all of it starts with this call to
1:37:30
Holiness we know there's more we know there's more
1:37:35
and the only way to get there is through vocation sacrifice giving ourselves back to God
1:37:41
through one of those two Avenues we cannot do that without the sacrament
1:37:48
the sacrament of marriage holy matrimony or the sacrament of holy orders
1:37:56
what precedes those sacraments so let's look at it from a metaphysical standpoint a functional standpoint
1:38:03
number one is it all comes through the church all sacraments come through the church
1:38:10
so let's talk about um put on your Catholic theology cap
1:38:17
what is the first Sacrament in the initiatory process baptism
1:38:22
so do we accept baptism from uh outside the Catholic church that we accepted as
1:38:29
valid in the Catholic Church yeah and so what draws the Protestant to the
1:38:37
Catholic church is they've already received sacramental Grace the grace of
1:38:43
the sacrament so I love to tell my Protestant Brethren you got one of them let me complete
1:38:53
you got you got the spoon there's a fork and knife and other stuff that goes with it
1:38:59
and so that's what caused them in a unique way now trick questions multiple
1:39:06
just applied theology
1:39:12
what is necessary for there to be a valid baptism or a baptism that is recognized by the Catholic Church two
1:39:19
things are necessary not period say it again
1:39:25
trinitarian fault formula in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit what else
1:39:31
water really complicated deal huh who may baptize
1:39:41
you don't have to be baptized roaring pagan
1:39:46
head shrinker from the depths of the jungles in South America is it valid
1:39:53
yes it is valid so
1:39:58
it's interesting that the sacrament of baptism is not limited by the minister in any way whatsoever is it
1:40:06
as long as the matter and the form are followed God honors the sacrament that
1:40:12
is a pretty low say it again well yeah that now that's the
1:40:17
disposition of the person we're going to go to the disposition of the person now we're focusing on the minister so the
1:40:23
state it's a good point but the state of the minister is not operative here is it
1:40:29
so if you follow the matter in the form God honors the sacrament God is bound to
1:40:36
the sacraments but he's not bound by the sacraments so the grace is the grace of the
1:40:42
sacrament is conveyed now let's talk to the other part which was mentioned is
1:40:48
the disposition of the one requesting baptism
1:40:53
is it possible to baptize a creature below the Age of Reason who is not
1:41:00
capable of asking for himself is that possible yeah we do that all the time exactly
1:41:09
why do we do that
1:41:17
Every Creature who opens the womb should be given back to him
1:41:24
who is the author of creation who is the author of procreation what drives us to
1:41:30
have this child baptized relationship with God we know that that belong that creature
1:41:37
belongs to him so trick question alert when do we
1:41:43
become a child of God
1:41:49
okay we got some we got some different answers so how many think that when you
1:41:55
are conceived you are a child of God how many think that okay how many of you think that uh when
1:42:02
you're born you're a child of God how many of you think that Catholic theology is very clear you are
1:42:09
not a child of God until you are baptized you are a creature you still have access
1:42:17
to actual Grace but until that's formalized until you wear the mark
1:42:23
until you are baptized you're not in Covenant relationship with God
1:42:29
you're not a child of God that's unchanging theology that goes Way
1:42:36
Way Back
1:42:42
okay correct he initiates the relationship he's
1:42:49
waiting for you to reciprocate so this is the author of adoption no one
1:42:54
is adopted against their will so when you apply these principles to it
1:43:01
you start to see that by adoption are we incorporated into the Covenant by
1:43:06
adoption we become children of God and Catholic when we look in the in in
1:43:11
Catholic theology and in our practice we afford infant baptism so that this Soul
1:43:16
Bears the indelible Mark of Christ and begins to be formed in the faith
1:43:22
formed in the identity of being a child of God now the next Sacrament what's it
1:43:34
well so the the next two sacraments of initiation are confirmation and first
1:43:41
communion doesn't matter which order they come in but there's two more steps
1:43:46
now you bring up a really really good point and that's that's where we're going to get to we're going to come back to but
1:43:53
what must happen at First Communion
1:44:00
Age of Reason so now the creature who is marked as a child of God begins to move in their
1:44:08
intellect and in their will to affirm that relationship
1:44:13
correct so do you see how this progression of a relationship is going
1:44:20
and so now the next one is confirmation what happens at confirmation
1:44:28
yeah it's we're going to go back and pick it up but just the sacrament if we're just
1:44:34
looking at the sacraments of initiation absent to prerequisite then we're going to come back and see where the
1:44:40
prerequisites necessary but what we've got is we've got a creature below the Age of Reason whose parents speak for
1:44:46
him and have him marked and brought into the faith he now has a covenant relationship
1:44:51
so that God will now speak to that creature for the rest of his life through the grace of Sacrament not just
1:44:58
the grace of actual Grace does that make sense
1:45:07
so once they're baptized God now has an Avenue of communication with them that
1:45:13
is beyond actual Grace that's the point to be made now that communication becomes more
1:45:18
perfected in the second sacrament whether that's confirmation or first communion but it's an act of the person
1:45:25
who has reached the Age of Reason and they're making an act requisite with
1:45:31
their will they may still be under the direction of their parents
1:45:36
at confirmation we're looking for someone of the maturity they may not be of the age of majority but they're the
1:45:42
maturity to be bound by their choices that's the language
1:45:48
in the United States it's pretty simple when a kid reaches the age of majority the parents are no lie no longer liable
1:45:54
for his actions legally do you know that when she's 18 it doesn't matter where
1:46:01
he's living he can sign contracts he can tear stuff up he can do whatever he wants to do but the parents are not
1:46:07
liable unless they choose to be so it's this age of majority or this age
1:46:13
whereby the person declares the Comfort mandate declares his desire to be in
1:46:19
formalized relationship follow
1:46:25
and so the movement now let's go back and pick up pennants so first of all modernly the sacrament
1:46:32
is called reconciliation which in fact is a misnomer
1:46:38
we are reconciled with God through all the sacraments we are reconciled with God through all
1:46:44
the sacraments the sacrament of penance or confession is how it was traditionally known
1:46:49
because it was by this action we were we were reconciled but anytime you Avail
1:46:55
yourself of the sacraments you are reconciled with God but there is a a prerequisite to all
1:47:03
sacraments all sacraments so even with baptism
1:47:09
being listed as the first or primary Sacrament what precedes that
1:47:15
penance we don't teach this when parents present themselves and
1:47:22
their child for baptism they should be freshly confessed the god parents should be freshly com
1:47:29
confessed anytime you come into the atmosphere of Sacrament you have to be
1:47:35
in a state of grace to receive all this the grace that's going to come through that Sacrament
1:47:41
we're not taught that so technically confession our Penance is the
1:47:48
prerequisite to all the other sacraments you you follow that logic
1:47:55
so once you follow that logic now you're ready for vocation it is only
1:48:02
now I'm not saying what we do I'm saying the way it's supposed to be
1:48:08
plan a all of a lot of us are living plans c d e
1:48:14
but we're talking about plan A plan a is the sacrament the sacrament of matrimony
1:48:23
traditionally was reserved to baptized Catholics in a state of grace
1:48:30
you know that the world was a different place our faith was a different place
1:48:38
but two souls who are baptized con confirmed and are in a state of taking
1:48:46
the Holy Eucharist taking communion marriage is going to look different if
1:48:52
you come into there fully initiated and fully formed
1:48:58
it marriage is just going to look different again that's plan a most of us are
1:49:05
living plan c d e h i j k
1:49:11
l m n o p but the point being is that to engage in
1:49:16
sacrificial theology there there has to be a foundation from which you engage in
1:49:22
that Sacrament so after you've been baptized first communion confirmed now you're ready for the
1:49:30
sacrament of uh sacrificial vocation either marriage or holy orders
1:49:37
make sense is the God's parents to bottom of the
1:49:44
State of Grace does that change the disposition such
1:49:52
that the sacrament is in Balance no it will not invalidate the sacrament
1:49:57
however it can impede the flow of grace through the sacrament that language is
1:50:02
very very important so all of us have a functional knowledge of hydrology whether we know it or not
1:50:09
and and so Grace as it is from its source
1:50:16
from its source it then comes to fonts and then from those fonts it is distributed
1:50:21
and so one of the fonts is the church what are we doing or what has been done
1:50:28
um as far as the diminution of the faith impedes the flow of grace through the
1:50:33
church it doesn't occlude it but it impedes it it chokes it down
1:50:40
now you can suck water out of a rag or you can drink out of a fire hose
1:50:45
and that's the that's the analogy is fully functional perishes fully
1:50:51
functional churches this is a fire hose this is a torrent of Grace
1:50:57
and you can Avail yourselves of it but as our practices deviate from the true faith and from Catholic Norms it gets
1:51:05
choked down more and more and more but all Grace flows through two
1:51:11
constructs and the extent to which we are conformed to that
1:51:16
is the extent to which Grace is impeded the two constructs of the church and
1:51:22
your vocation so next slide please we'll talk about what
1:51:27
this looks like functionally so I'm going to pick up the father and
1:51:33
the mother all Grace flows to you and when I say you receive
1:51:40
Grace only through vocation again how many of you were Sons or daughters
1:51:46
all right that's the way you received Grace initially
1:51:51
is it all flows through the marriage of which you are a product
1:51:58
to the extent to which that was a functional Catholic marriage a proper
1:52:04
Catholic plan a marriage that's the extent to which you received Grace
1:52:12
now before we say I didn't receive enough Grace understand something about Grace
1:52:18
it's when you present this to God you're like the little boy
1:52:24
at the Loaves and Fishes he had a greasy sack
1:52:30
he just handed it over to Christ he said here he didn't say I better keep one loaf and
1:52:37
fish in case this doesn't go well he gave up everything he had and our
1:52:43
Lord multiplies that's what he does is he multiplies our efforts he perfects
1:52:48
our imperfect action what he does not do and cannot do is supply action where there is none
1:52:56
so it flows through the marriage the office
1:53:02
of marriage and the office of father and the office of mother so let's get something understood with regard to
1:53:09
Authority Authority providential Authority
1:53:16
has nothing to do with Merit let that sink in
1:53:22
Authority has nothing to do with Merit what does providential Authority have everything to do with
1:53:29
Providence the classic example is our Lord Jesus Christ in front of pilate he says to him
1:53:36
the authority you have over me comes from above do you remember this subjected himself to that even unto
1:53:44
death pilate is within his bounds of authority
1:53:50
to order the death or even to step away and fail to intercede for Christ
1:53:58
and Christ subjects himself to that Authority even unto death
1:54:04
so let me ask you a question we've been through some theological gymnastics are you ready to do a little
1:54:10
theological problem solving and just use your Catholic conscience
1:54:16
what if pilate had said to our Lord I order you to make sacrifice to the
1:54:22
Caesar as God would our Lord have done it
1:54:28
you're pretty sure about that I am too so this is the test of obedience
1:54:34
is its obedience within the bounds of providential authority as long as it's not against
1:54:39
morals and theology and so our Lord was not going to be
1:54:45
obedient unto unto sin So Physical death is not the test physical harm may not be
1:54:53
the test but spiritual harm is do you see the difference
1:54:58
you see the application so providential Authority is not a
1:55:05
function of Merit now this is where the rubber meets the road modernly we always talk about
1:55:11
um I have a father wound how many of you hear this language well
1:55:17
my mother's uh popular secular psychologists are exactly right every
1:55:24
single person in this room has a father wound
1:55:31
yeah every single one of you that's the father and we're the ones who wounded him
1:55:37
so once you get it understood that way and the thing is the even if it was an
1:55:43
abusive father even if it was an uh an abandoning father or a horrible mother
1:55:48
let's look at this in light of Providence God will always give you what you need
1:55:53
not what you want I am a timid Soul I'm a tepid Soul I'm a
1:56:00
weak soul don't let anything else fool you I needed the Exemplar father a father
1:56:06
that I could follow and emulate because I wasn't Tough Enough to be abused or to be abandoned
1:56:15
but the ideal is accentuated either in the example or in the absence
1:56:22
you know what I mean so follow this example a little bit how how many of you know the exemplary young
1:56:30
parent the exemplary young father or mother whose own childhood was a wreck
1:56:36
and there are a fantastic parent how many of you know that person foreign
1:56:43
so where does that come from but modern psychology tells us and we
1:56:49
I'll be willing to bet most of us have repeated the statement you can't give what you don't have
1:56:56
come on fess up how many of you said that that's exactly what we're being asked to
1:57:01
do it's exactly what we're being asked to do did Jesus say to the young boy open
1:57:08
up your sack and feed this crowd he said no give it to me and I'll make it enough
1:57:14
and so if you understand that that's what God is asking us to do Christ is
1:57:20
asking us to do whatever you've got give me all of it and I'll make it enough
1:57:26
from whatever your situation is then you're understanding the ability to multiply and augment Grace
1:57:35
if we're saying that you can't give what you don't have then by the law of diminishing returns there would be no
1:57:42
love left just stop and think about it because so much love would be lost to
1:57:48
each generation that by now there would be absolutely no charity or love
1:57:54
do you see what I mean so this influx is coming from somewhere and it's a product of Grace and to the
1:58:01
amount that we are disposed of to Grace now we can convey Grace so let me bring
1:58:07
you that brings us to how the father and the mother in plan a are to be uh conduits of that
1:58:16
Grace so Grace flows through the patriarching
1:58:24
what does that mean Grace flows through the mail
1:58:29
remember I told you first up Authority and Merit have nothing to do with each other
1:58:35
okay so let's get that off the table is the Devotion to the man or the office
1:58:44
the office so each of each of the wives in here
1:58:49
have prayed in each of the young women in here yet to be married should be praying
1:58:55
for God to send a husband a pure husband a righteous husband and you should also
1:59:03
be praying that he's able to recognize you because you ain't going to find Mr right if you ain't being Mrs Right
1:59:12
and it works the other way so we as marriage we have it easy we have picked the instrument of our
1:59:18
purification
1:59:24
the religious the religious not so I think
1:59:30
and so our instrument of purification is someone who loves us and we love them
1:59:36
and we we you have to give thanks to God for whoever is your instrument of purification whoever that person is that
1:59:43
shows you how holy you're not give thanks to God for them incidentally man if you're ever engaging
1:59:50
on this later on we're going to talk about the necessity to cultivate virtue and sometimes you just seem stuck
1:59:56
because you don't know which one to address first just ask your wife she'll help you out
2:00:05
hang on because as Paul Harvey would say here's the rest of the story
2:00:12
and so the man's the man's job is to provide
2:00:18
protect to lead and guide what happened in the garden is there are
2:00:25
three sins of Eve and there are five sins of Adam and so all this is happening
2:00:30
simultaneously but when women begin to lead men begin to step back
2:00:35
and so this skews the flow of Grace
2:00:41
so what is the woman's job in this because Grace does not flow even if it
2:00:46
flows through the patriarchy it doesn't flow without the woman
2:00:51
now first of all this is a these are areas to your modern ear is going to
2:00:57
inflame so I'm going to warn you ahead of time we are not equal
2:01:05
the concept of equality diminishes both of us and it seeks us a common ground we
2:01:12
are not equal bottom line the sum is greater than the parts
2:01:17
you can do things women can do things men can't do men do can do things that
2:01:22
women can't do and we do well to stay out of each other's Lane
2:01:28
when we come together this is when we're truly magnificent it's magnified it's beyond
2:01:34
what we can do individually so this concept of support
2:01:40
and the woman prepares the heart and it starts before the child's ever born
2:01:47
how many of you know if I use the term fetal imprinting how many of you know what I mean
2:01:54
this is a very real thing among all species and is essentially following it from a
2:02:00
spiritual standpoint the first human experience that the soul has is its
2:02:06
mother's reaction to its presence and so stop and think women can do a lot
2:02:12
of things you're amazing in a lot of areas but something you absolutely cannot do is
2:02:18
remain ambivalent when you find out you're pregnant that cannot be met with emotional
2:02:25
neutrality you're one of two dispositions it's
2:02:31
either positive response or a negative response and it's going to be gradiated one way or the other but it's it you
2:02:38
cannot remain ambivalent so that's the first experience first
2:02:44
human experience the soul has so it's either acceptance or rejection
2:02:50
it's either joyful acceptance or Dreadful rejection what is the mother's
2:02:56
reaction and then you go on to what is the mother's reaction to the father
2:03:02
of the child when she hears his voice what is the emotional reaction is it Joy
2:03:09
is it love is it anticipation is it dread is it the desire for distance do
2:03:16
you see how she's already developing the child's relationship with its father before it's ever born
2:03:25
well ultimately that relationship with the father's relationship with God
2:03:30
what is your emotional response to the mass does she pray does she sing how is
2:03:36
she exercising our faith is she calm is she peaceful
2:03:42
is she tumultuous is she anxious and you're going to be surprised that when you look back on your children or
2:03:49
on other people what was the disposition of the woman during the pregnancy
2:03:56
make sense so I'll give you a scriptural example
2:04:03
the scene is the eviction from the garden are you ready now before you're beating yourself up and doing the oh woe
2:04:11
is me there's a cure for all of it or an approach and we'll we'll get it just
2:04:17
relax so the scriptural precedent is it is the eviction seen at the Garden
2:04:24
you got it So Adam and Eve are leaving the garden
2:04:30
what do you suppose that conversation was like
2:04:36
she's saying I don't care if you are the last man on Earth and he says I am
2:04:46
so is there a lot of Joy going on they have Lost That Loving Feeling
2:04:53
and so they're leaving the garden but they have conjugal relation
2:05:00
if you read the scripture first conjugal relation happens after the eviction
2:05:06
so what do you suppose that was like loving and tender
2:05:12
no so what do you what kind of spirits do you think were there at that first
2:05:20
conjugal Union so give me some idea just name some general attributes what kind of spirits
2:05:27
were there you think resentment was there you think anger was there you think Vengeance was there
2:05:33
you think anger at God was there you think all those were there anybody care to tell me the personality
2:05:41
profile on Cain who was the first product of that you see how that works
2:05:49
all of this can be overcome because ultimately God does not say Okay Cain you were predestined to die a horrible
2:05:55
death he doesn't say that he appears actually in voice form and
2:06:00
gives Cain beautiful spiritual Direction he says sin fourth chapter of Genesis
2:06:09
sin is a demon lurking at your door but you can Master it if you do good
2:06:15
this is after the murder or this is him this is after the Exile after Cain's
2:06:21
born and he's plotting the murder of Abel God doesn't back totally off
2:06:27
he's trying to intervene and he says sin is a demon lurking at your door but you
2:06:32
can Master it if you do good what is Kane's response he goes and kills his brother
2:06:41
the point that I'm making is the mother is already shaping the Soul's
2:06:46
relationship to his biological father to the constructs of authority to God to
2:06:53
the church she's shaping all of these struck constructs in this Soul before
2:06:59
it's ever born who has the power
2:07:06
Authority and power two different things power is the ability to affect change
2:07:12
Authority is the right to use that power
2:07:18
that's this is straight out of Saint Thomas so who has the power and is it consistent with the authority in the
2:07:25
marriage The Authority in the marriage is not the husband the authority and the marriage is God
2:07:31
and so the husbands will has to be in Conformity with God's
2:07:36
will that desire for salvation that desire for righteousness so mother and father are working here
2:07:43
now it comes to us Sons or daughters and so this function the mother is
2:07:51
written in um in blue and so
2:07:56
she's shaping the father as a construct in the heart of the Sun
2:08:03
she's shaping the construct in the heart of the Sun and what we're finding is this is a very
2:08:09
very real concept
2:08:16
especially if the mother is the spiritual head of the household by
2:08:22
assuming that role nine times out of ten if she is the
2:08:27
spiritual head of the household by assuming the role of spiritual head the sun's going to distance himself from the
2:08:33
faith nine out of ten times we'll talk deeper into that
2:08:40
so to receive love unconditionally do you think that's a typographical error
2:08:48
that's not the way we hear it modernly is it we're supposed to receive unconditional
2:08:54
love right no we're supposed to receive love
2:08:59
unconditionally what's the difference it's luciferian to say I am do
2:09:07
I am entitled to unconditional love and I get to determine whether you're giving
2:09:13
me unconditional love or not does that sound familiar it's exactly what we do
2:09:19
when we're critical of how our mothers and our fathers love us
2:09:25
it's never going to be enough you ever notice that no matter how good your mother or your
2:09:31
father were or how perfectly or imperfectly they loved you it is never going to be good enough according to the
2:09:38
specular list so what do you do you do it in a way that expands the flow
2:09:44
of Grace not occludes it expands it constantly wanting to expand it we receive love unconditionally what does
2:09:51
that mean thanks be to God for whatever comes thanks be to God
2:09:57
whatever we receive thanks be to God
2:10:02
Providence is at work thanks be to God even if we suffer at the free will act
2:10:08
of someone else thanks be to God this is giving me an opportunity to
2:10:13
conform my life to God through the Christ through the Christ
2:10:20
how many of you have prayed to be a saint there's no shortcuts you figured that
2:10:25
out how many years stopped praying for patience
2:10:31
I figured that one out and so this idea of being becoming a
2:10:37
saint you're asking God to Chisel away everything that is not a
2:10:45
saint people ask Michelangelo how did you do the David he said I took this big chunk of marble and I chipped away everything
2:10:51
that wasn't David so when you ask to be a saint
2:10:57
it's violence to chip away and take away everything that is not of God that is
2:11:04
not saintly so this is our first spiritual
2:11:10
um skill set is as a son or a daughter is to receive love unconditionally
2:11:17
it's not that you have to perfect it but you have to recognize it and realize that this is what I got to do
2:11:23
wherever I am and whatever I'm receiving it's not why this is happening to me but
2:11:29
how can I use it for sanctification third type of Grace
2:11:35
the third type of Grace is sanctifying Grace sanctifying Grace is how we can form
2:11:41
ourselves to God in adversity what does that mean how do we become Christ
2:11:48
how do we join our suffering to his how do we Embrace what is happening rather
2:11:54
than try to avoid it do you see the difference
2:11:59
so there's an interesting there's there's when you look at some of the the hymns there's a Protestant hymn
2:12:06
um and it it's a translation of a Catholic hymn the Protestant version is for us he
2:12:13
endured cross and Grave you remember this remember that line
2:12:18
it's for us he endured Crossing grave the Catholic version was for us he
2:12:24
embraced Crossing do you see the difference it is the embracing it is the the Via
2:12:32
Dolorosa he's not being beat to Calvary they couldn't stop him what made him get up
2:12:39
the desire to make good on the sacrifice if we subject the modern rules of
2:12:47
discernment to Holy Week it would go like this
2:12:52
oh yeah they they're really supporting you Palm Sunday it's you're excellent you're going to be the king it's all
2:12:59
good everybody recognizes you uh oh you're getting a little resistance on money on Monday there's those money
2:13:06
changers oh Church hierarchy put a price on your head obviously your father doesn't want
2:13:12
you to go through with this wait you're betrayed one more sign that you shouldn't go through with the
2:13:18
passion Thursday night early Friday morning he's in the garden
2:13:23
let this cup pass from me three times he asked what has he met with
2:13:29
silence obviously God doesn't want him to go through the sacrifice right
2:13:34
do you see him being facetious so what is that silence three times ask
2:13:42
in the garden it's the most masculine of answers do the last thing you were told
2:13:49
even to the point of death Mother Teresa lived this she heard one for one word from God and then labored
2:13:56
50 years on that word this is what we're talking about
2:14:02
receiving love unconditionally Jesus does not get on Friday early Friday morning the apostles are asleep
2:14:11
he doesn't get it's it's going to be okay just hang in there he doesn't get that
2:14:17
does the Blessed Mother get that word from Simeon it'll be okay no
2:14:23
this is that Conformity to will that no matter what happens there has to be
2:14:28
absolute trust fear and Trust cannot occupy the same space
2:14:33
so this is receiving love unconditionally the feminine is to shape
2:14:39
the father as a construct in the heart of the son this is not the mother saying well your
2:14:45
dad's been under a lot of stress and he's a little bit short-tempered he just really doesn't understand
2:14:50
don't do things like that don't take the edge off of that don't contradict
2:14:57
each other in the presence of the children don't correct in the presence of children
2:15:03
and when you go to your husband or you go to your wife there has to be charity
2:15:08
it has to be the desire for the Salvation of Soul has to be the motivation in anything you bring forward
2:15:16
so to receive love unconditionally now let's go to brother or sister
2:15:23
unconditionally share love sibling rivalry is not a holy construct
2:15:30
why not sibling rivalry doesn't matter how old you are but sibling rivalry essentially
2:15:38
is the concept that a father or Mother's Love is limited
2:15:43
and if I'm going to get my share it's going to diminish your share do you see what I mean
2:15:49
this is at the heart of sibling rivalry true sibling relationship is to share
2:15:55
love unconditionally and even to recommend the other to your father and your mother
2:16:01
this is Jesus speaking from the cross forgive them for they know not what they do
2:16:06
it's the desire for salvation it is the desire for Holiness for each
2:16:13
other make sense so the sharing of love unconditionally
2:16:19
it's what is Jesus's relationship to us as brother
2:16:29
he desires Union with God the Father for us maybe even more purely than we do for
2:16:36
ourselves so there's an old joke that two little boys come down it's a poor household and
2:16:41
the mother says there's just enough oatmeal for one serving for breakfast
2:16:47
Jesus would let his brother have the oatmeal so one turns the other and he
2:16:53
says you be Jesus
2:16:58
so it's the unconditionally sharing love and then the feminine is to Exemplar
2:17:04
this attribute refine the father in the heart of the son and it's the understanding from the feminine
2:17:11
standpoint that a Father's Love A Mother's Love is Limitless
2:17:17
how many of you have multiple children how many of you when you had the first child love that child with all the
2:17:25
possible love you could give them and then the second child came so if you were using all the Love on the
2:17:32
first child what happened to the second child is he Loveless
2:17:38
no well it depends if you ask him uh
2:17:45
but God increases our capacity to love he increases our capacity for Grace only
2:17:52
by doing it only by constantly stretching and constantly seeking more
2:17:59
sanctifying Grace sanctifying Grace is a result of the use of the grace of the sacrament
2:18:06
it's the desire for Holiness within vocation and it's pursuing Holiness this
2:18:13
is sanctifying Grace this is what makes us pleasing to God
2:18:18
so then let's look at spouse so the station of spouse is to give love
2:18:24
unconditionally we receive it we share it now we're giving it unconditionally
2:18:30
and that means without reservation that means without any conditions
2:18:38
spousal Union is total gift of self without reservation
2:18:44
and it's total gift of self this is anytime you talk about spousal
2:18:51
union now what you'll notice that all of the grace that you receive as a son
2:18:57
flows through the marriage of which you are a product when you are a brother or a sister a
2:19:04
sibling all Grace flows through the marriage of which you are a product you do not have direct access to
2:19:13
vocational Grace your own line your own thought until you enter vocation
2:19:20
so you are under this flow until you end until you become a spouse
2:19:26
so from the power and authority discussion this is different for boys and girls men and women it's different
2:19:34
so the man the male child is going to start to move out from under his
2:19:41
father's Authority as he ages and the father is going to have
2:19:47
instead of the right to command he begins to cultivate the right to counsel
2:19:54
and then as this the boy leaves the house now he has the obligation to counsel
2:20:01
here's where it's different for for girls until she is married
2:20:07
he has the right to command why because he has the obligation to
2:20:14
ensure her purity this is an obligation so all right is
2:20:19
born out of obligation when you understand it that way you
2:20:25
realize that the masculine role is a servant's role it is very much a servant's role and so
2:20:33
what he's doing is he is obliged to ensure her Purity so that at the wedding
2:20:39
mass at the nuptial mass at the moment of holy matrimony when he hands her over
2:20:45
a couple of things are happening and let's talk for a second about the imagery of holy matrimony
2:20:52
first of all is the understanding of the the groomsmen
2:20:57
the groomsmen's original um Duty their original purpose
2:21:05
was to all go to penance with the groom the day before and then to pray vigils
2:21:11
all vigils all that night to main make sure he was in a state of purity
2:21:16
he was in a state of Chase Purity leading up to the nuptial Mass
2:21:23
do you see the exact inversion under diabolical influence what were the bridesmaids same thing
2:21:30
they were to attend to the bride and make sure she stayed uh in a state of
2:21:36
Purity to pray vigils to ensure that she was in that state why was it tradition
2:21:43
that the groom did not get to see the bride in her wedding dress
2:21:49
so that there was no possibility of impure thought before he encounters her at the altar
2:21:58
amazing and when the father brings her up and she's wearing the Veil
2:22:04
her body her Corpus is veiled this is the protection he has kept her
2:22:10
in his household and so the wedding dress is an extension of the household she's veiled she's covered he brings her
2:22:18
up he lifts the Veil hands her hand to the groom and what
2:22:24
he's doing is passing the responsibility for her honor her Integrity her Purity
2:22:30
her protection he's passing that to the groom
2:22:36
that's what's happening in a spiritual sense and so when young women move outside the
2:22:42
house this Authority is now diminished because they're open to other influences
2:22:50
but household Authority is extremely important especially for unmarried women
2:22:55
it's extremely important what's at stake is really really important virginity Purity because the
2:23:04
womb of a woman is the most precious place on it's the most sacred place on all the world in all the world it's
2:23:11
there that flesh is knit upon a soul it must be us in the Purity the Chastity
2:23:19
must be insured so that the conjugal Union engaged in this way in the
2:23:24
sacrament of matrimony makes an abode for a soul that is pure and the Soul arrives in a place of
2:23:31
Purity and holiness when you hear it described that way it makes sense there's that resonance
2:23:39
if you're not hearing that resonance or if there's some Discord in what I'm saying then where is the modern heavy
2:23:46
metal that doesn't recognize this as classical music
2:23:51
and that's the music analogy so to give love unconditionally now we've
2:23:57
got Grace flowing directly into the marriage or into the religious life
2:24:03
it's and so now this unconditional Union unconditional Union is our Conformity to
2:24:11
authority to the authority structure so Authority all of us are in positions of
2:24:17
authority when I say that do you immediately think about those Downstream from your Authority
2:24:26
most people do so when you're in a position of authority it means you're in a mid position you're receiving it and
2:24:32
discharging it there's two ways to abuse authority one is to fail to exercise it and the
2:24:38
other one is to fail to yield to it yeah and so the failure to exercise it
2:24:44
it's not your authority to do with as you will God has put you in a position in an office of authority because this
2:24:51
is through which Grace Flows if you're charged with the duty to correct then you must correct
2:24:59
remember that all authority flows first vertically it's a function of Justice it
2:25:04
flows first from God the Father before it can be distributed horizontally
2:25:09
that's what starts Happening Here fatherhood and motherhood is
2:25:15
responsibility for a soul and we lose ourselves in the identity
2:25:20
now of spouse and father and mother and so fatherhood and motherhood is
2:25:27
decided by our superiors in the religious life used to be now this is a departure now men will join the Seminary
2:25:35
or go to the bishop and he and they'll say I'm called to be a priest that's the same as someone coming to a
2:25:42
priest and saying I'm called to have children therefore I need to be married do you see the the difference
2:25:49
you have to be called to give your life to God and let God decide through your
2:25:54
Superior or directly whether you're going to be a father or a mother
2:25:59
make sense now please do not confuse fatherhood and motherhood with being a
2:26:06
sire or a damn modernly there are lots of sires and lots of dams and there's very few
2:26:13
fathers and mothers what happens if the child is born and
2:26:20
then skips straight to fatherhood before marriage before any of these skills are picked up is that going to work
2:26:28
not well so you see how Modern Life and Society I
2:26:36
mean this was a term I just learned this last week you guys know the term baby daddy
2:26:45
that's a sire that's not a father that's a sire that's a function of
2:26:50
biology this is spiritual fatherhood motherhood requisite with biological fatherhood and motherhood only when
2:26:57
you're in the sacrament of matrimony you've given love unconditionally you enter that in a pure State Grace is at
2:27:03
its maximum we're talking fire hose Grace now you're ready for the responsibility of a soul
2:27:09
but God is going to bless the physical act whether you're ready or not
2:27:16
back to baptism you follow the formula what do you get the sacrament
2:27:22
you follow the conjugal formula what do you get doesn't matter what your intent was
2:27:31
you ever notice people don't use the term dabble with pregnancy they'll tell you I dabbled in the occult
2:27:38
I dabbled in Black Magic you can't dabble in pregnancy you either are you're not
2:27:44
you're in that flow of Grace or you're not we're looking for fire hose Grace We're
2:27:50
love we're looking for the maximum flow and so this is the responsibility for a
2:27:55
soul we lose our individual identity in the spousal role it's the understanding that if you're a married man or a
2:28:02
married woman anything you do that is inconsistent with your vocation opens you up to
2:28:09
diabolical vulnerability it's that simple any thought you have
2:28:17
that is not consistent with your vocation opens you up to diabolical suggestion
2:28:22
Everybody follow that all right and so then this last one is where a lot of us
2:28:28
in this room are approaching this stage patriarchy and matriarchy we're
2:28:33
perfecting our sacrifice to God what does that mean is we're seeking to
2:28:39
increase the Merit of our prayer by trying to stay in a state of sanctifying grace
2:28:45
our marriages are our vocations are mature enough that there's no longer
2:28:51
we're not chafing under those traces or within those lines our path is set now
2:28:56
we're wanting to to maximize the amount of Grace that's flowing through us and to us so that we can benefit those below
2:29:04
us down to the third and fourth generation our children and our grandchildren
2:29:10
and so you're working on the Merit of your prayer you're praying together your vote you're in your intercessions and
2:29:18
desires should be in Union there should be a great Harmony in your prayer and in
2:29:23
your practices that's the way it should be again that's plan a a lot of us are living plan C D or e l m n o p whatever
2:29:31
it may be but it's not plan a I'm just telling you about plan a it is
2:29:36
achievable so that's the flow of Grace um we're at 10 till
2:29:44
I'm willing to stay and answer questions
2:29:49
say it again
2:29:55
I have no idea I mean I'm not being flippant I think it
2:30:02
has Merit and shouldn't be taught um the understanding of marriage prep is
2:30:08
skewed as well we can do an hour on marriage and what has happened to marriage within the church that's
2:30:14
another topic um and I'm happy to to entertain talks on
2:30:19
other things if you want we've got a few minutes for questions I'm willing to stay after but
2:30:26
um we we can go for a while
2:30:38
okay no she doesn't have to do it she doesn't have to do it so let's go to the
2:30:44
premise and how quick you got to she has to do it um so the first one is he doesn't want
2:30:50
to do it so you could try incessant nagging and insistence that he become the spiritual
2:30:57
head how does that work nobody else have an act you know any
2:31:02
luck with that no you're not going to he's not going to react that way and so what it amounts to
2:31:09
is I'll give you a musical analogy um y'all fairly familiar with how a
2:31:15
symphony works so let's work let's focus on the violin section okay
2:31:21
he's the first chair of violin you're the second chair violin
2:31:26
fair enough all right so for this I'll role play your husband for a moment and
2:31:32
so he's not there by Merit now many people think that first chair is better
2:31:37
than the second chair that's not true who picks first chair for any selection is the conductor
2:31:44
and so that changes so there's a popular misconception now I'm not talking about high school Brass Band where the best
2:31:50
trombone players first trombone player it's not what I'm talking about so in a symphony
2:31:55
that first chair fiddle first chair violin is going to change so for this particular exercise he's
2:32:01
first chair I'm first chair I'm playing along I make a mistake I'm half a beat off what are you going
2:32:08
to do under your model you take your bow and you swat me
2:32:14
now both of us are off even though you're right both of us are
2:32:20
off so what are you going to do we're playing along you're going to follow me
2:32:27
yeah yeah until I get so far off that it affects
2:32:34
the Integrity of the symphony until I get so far I can be on if I'm in
2:32:39
the wrong movement now what are you going to do you're not going to follow me but what is your response
2:32:47
silence and then when I hear that silence to my right second chair I'm going to know
2:32:55
that I'm an error now the priest is a conductor
2:33:01
God is the composer and so now it comes to the attention of me first chair I got one of two things
2:33:08
to do I can either look at the conductor like the woman you've put here with me
2:33:15
or I can look at you in that moment you can say something that he will hear
2:33:24
and so it's it's very very subtle but bottom line what I'm what I'm saying is
2:33:29
you all have the experience of the other method and it doesn't work so what do you have to lose trying mine
2:33:35
your pride that's exactly what you have to lose and that's it
2:33:40
men on the other hand is we can get prideful but we we lose all Harmony when we're
2:33:47
butting heads so for instance um if I'm following how many of you know
2:33:54
have led a horse and had him suddenly stop so for instance if if
2:34:01
um I'm leading you're the wife I'm the husband I'm leading and I come to this point
2:34:08
so this is a morals or doctrine error and I go right there you follow me
2:34:17
no remember you can't cross morals or doctrine remember that
2:34:23
so when um this takes many forms so let's let's get
2:34:28
off the analogies and talk more real life um the boys want to play soccer I want
2:34:33
them to play soccer and the games are on Sunday so you simply say I can't go
2:34:40
and I can't give you my blessing as their mother that they can go you're not telling them they can't go
2:34:47
do you see the difference and so it has to be this constant understanding that you go to here and
2:34:55
you can't go past this sensitivity and this resoluteness
2:35:00
exceeds and extends into all areas of life is you have to stop
2:35:07
and then what's happening is you're letting him know that proper Dominion he's taking you to a place you can't go
2:35:15
in your sensibilities and then he's going to ask okay what and expect him to
2:35:21
get mad well why not because my faith says I don't need to do
2:35:27
that on Sunday you got too many rules and you and you just quietly say
2:35:35
too many not enough whatever it may be that's what I'm going to do
2:35:41
then it comes I demand great we can I love the demand language I can't comply
2:35:48
you see what I mean this is a whole different way of dealing with these issues it is a whole different way the
2:35:55
wife is there for counsel but it's counsel out of a sense of purity
2:36:01
and if you are truly changed if you are living a pure and holy life your husband's going to notice it whether he
2:36:07
acts like it or not and this works the other way men who have an experience
2:36:13
and they're going to poke you to see if it's real they're going to poke you to see if it's
2:36:18
real are you sure they got a 99 sale at whatever the store
2:36:26
is on Sunday you want to go do you hear that language no can't go
2:36:33
it's Sunday well now you're consistent so where they're going to trip you up is in the consistency
2:36:39
and so if you if you decide this is a hill you're going to die on make sure that Hill has some strategic
2:36:45
significance that makes sense okay next question
2:36:54
does that scare you
2:37:03
the children you know you're presenting them but what if the parents don't think
2:37:09
about the children okay so this is this is a really nicely praised question so I'm going to corrupt
2:37:15
it all right you ready lady are you asking me about the grand bomb baptism in the sink
2:37:22
thank you all right
2:37:27
is it valid is it valid yeah sure it is if you follow the formula it's valid is
2:37:33
it listen no why is it not listed where's the consent
2:37:41
okay so if it's illicit does not mean it's not valid the child's baptized
2:37:48
but you open yourself up to significant retaliation the demon will take you to
2:37:54
the back wood shed and so understand that in all the provisions for anyone other than the
2:38:00
normal minister to administer the sacrament it's out of necessity
2:38:05
meaning that there must be imminent death there must be some circumstances there why this can't be done in the
2:38:12
normal way does that make sense and so the other thing is that in order
2:38:17
to make it illicit you have to inform the priest in whose jurisdiction you
2:38:22
perform the baptism so that that child can be entered into the sacramentary record
2:38:29
there has to be the church record it has to be officially and then what the
2:38:34
priest is going to ask you is okay describe to me exactly what you did and if there was anything that was
2:38:39
inconsistent um he can sedate the baptism or bring it into Catholic Norms or redo it
2:38:47
but we had something in the old way say again yes it will make it listen
2:38:55
um but well you still have to have their consent
2:39:00
yeah yeah and so what I'm saying is the only way you can pass over consent is if
2:39:06
there are incapable if they if they're killed or you know for whatever reason they're incapable you still have to have
2:39:13
the consent but in the case you know while scenario
2:39:18
you're watching little Johnny he's not baptized he starts choking on a toy you
2:39:24
panic uh now you can't give him the toy
2:39:29
I can see the wheels turning you can't manufacture the scenario
2:39:34
that's a whole nother sin um but in an imagined scenario where the
2:39:40
parents are not there then they are going to need to give their sin their consent as part of this sedation process
2:39:47
that makes it uh listen it is valid but it's not listed
2:39:55
and so you're still opening yourself up for retaliation
2:40:01
does that make sense I don't understand that that does not like them opening yourself up for
2:40:08
retaliation okay all right when you act outside your Authority
2:40:16
backs out acts out act outside your Authority you open yourself up meaning
2:40:21
that you don't have protection because you're outside your Authority so view Authority and power power is the badge
2:40:28
Authority as the gun if I use the gun consistent with the badge if even if I'm
2:40:34
a duly appointed law officer now I'm personally liable so I'm not I can't
2:40:39
expect protection from the sacraments or from prayer because I stepped outside of this Authority let me put it another way
2:40:46
you ever been in the grocery store you're in roush's looking for that hog head cheese and that little kid's
2:40:52
throwing a conniption fit you can whoop him
2:40:57
you got the power I have even volunteered
2:41:02
but I don't have the authority so if you whoop him who's going to do what his Daddy's going
2:41:09
to come find you and whoop you that's retaliation that's what I'm talking about so the
2:41:14
demon starts to exacerbate um and he's present to those not in a
2:41:20
state of grace so your retaliation is specifically going to be you're going to drive a wedge between your son and your
2:41:27
daughter-in-law that it's going to be extremely hard to remove and the Demon's going to constantly you want that Faith
2:41:34
that's what that Faith does is it baptizes children against their will it does things that don't respect
2:41:41
you as a father or a mother that's the form retaliation takes that's what I'm talking about
2:41:48
so valid means it's valid list it means it's not legal and the actor so I'll
2:41:53
give you another example of valid and listen priest is drunk offers the holy sacrifice of the mass
2:41:59
follows the rubric does what it says prays the right prayers but he's drunk and he's in a
2:42:06
state of sin is the mass valid it's illicit because he's compromised
2:42:12
now who pray who pays that price he does that's the best way to think about it so
2:42:18
if the sacrament is valid and illicit the demon can't touch it
2:42:24
in every case of possession we've had though the demon has argued that at least one of the sacraments was invalid
2:42:31
and or illicit he's challenging the sacrament it doesn't mean his argument is controlling
2:42:38
doesn't mean that at all but he's challenging it in the person's mind
2:42:44
this is why it's so necessary to have a sacramental record uh or a sacramentary we've had lots of cases where people
2:42:50
said oh yeah I was baptized by my grandmother when I was a child there's no entry
2:42:59
any other questions
2:43:21
it does it drives a wedge between the husband and the wife this is and so what has to happen is that needs to be
2:43:28
addressed all the way back here so you see how a defect here is going to
2:43:35
manifest itself over here so this girl who is doing this she's
2:43:40
having an issue when she's 8 10 12 years old and then it's going to manifest when she's 18. do you see what I mean
2:43:48
and so that Conformity to Authority and to Grace starts early on and has to be constant if it's happening then you look
2:43:56
back and you say okay which one of these is is missing and more often than not it goes all the
2:44:03
way to here and so this is a real this is an understanding or a reorienting to God
2:44:10
the understanding that it's not what I didn't get it's what I did get and whatever I did get if I offer that
2:44:18
back to God with Thanksgiving he multiplies it and purifies it in my heart
2:44:23
does that make sense so you find out where the the Obex or the impediment is now to understand how
2:44:31
the Diabolical works Angels were created to augment the flow
2:44:36
of grace through this schema so demons impede the flow of Grace
2:44:43
they're still fixated on Grace in a specific application but now they're
2:44:48
inverted now they militate against it and so they seek to impede Grace angels
2:44:55
are working to augment Grace and here's the difference is the Diabolical will go everywhere
2:45:03
they are not resisted angels will only go where they're invited
2:45:10
so your marriage Angel your guardian angel the communication between your guardian angel and the guardian angel of
2:45:17
your children enlist their help but they will stand there silently until you do
2:45:24
enlist their help enlist their help constantly if you're putting your hands on the head
2:45:31
of those children as a father and blessing them on a daily basis you're blessing your home in a daily basis it's
2:45:38
a whole different atmosphere these children grow up totally different
2:45:44
but if we're concerned with our own concerns and our own issues then
2:45:50
finding us what's missing back down here
2:45:58
don't worry it's one of those things
2:46:03
so so the way to fix it
2:46:11
um is first of all to identify the impediments to Grace in us and so there's two ways to do that
2:46:17
the first one is to go back and look and to say for what have I been unthankful
2:46:23
because Thanksgiving is the key to unwrapping this this mess right here
2:46:29
and so if every prayer every thought of God begins with thanks be to God
2:46:36
and then you start to conform your mind to that understanding because I'm through with Steve unconditionally
2:46:41
whatever I've received um now God show me how to use it and so
2:46:46
it's a very simple thing if we're asking why is this happening to me we're close
2:46:52
to Grace if we ask how can I use this for my
2:46:57
sanctification now we're open to Grace so it's it's the difference between having the cup upside down and having it
2:47:03
this way so that's the first disposition then the next disposition or the next area to work on is virtue
2:47:11
is design the good for the other and to work on building up the virtues what are
2:47:16
those habits that dispose us to Grace what are those things that we can can do
2:47:21
in our life to open us up to Grace so that we can become conduits of Grace
2:47:26
and so that's an extremely important thing St Thomas says the vicious Behavior has to stop before the
2:47:32
cultivation of virtue can begin and one of the things that you're going to notice
2:47:38
um and when I say you if this is a general youth we one of the things you're going to notice is
2:47:45
as long as you have a taste for talking about people in a derogatory way you're not going to make any progress
2:47:52
and so you have to Simply stop that once you stop that and you start
2:47:58
thinking of people in charitable terms and the desire for salvation then you can start thinking of yourself
2:48:04
differently now that's the that's the the beginning of that path to Virtue because the
2:48:10
Diabolical wants to keep this running commentary to constantly point out to you the defects of everybody else
2:48:18
if we're confessing the sins of others we're neglecting the sins of ourselves our own
2:48:29
you're on the spot you're going to be on our YouTube channel
2:48:38
there we go and you said something about telling us about a website oh yeah and so there's a
2:48:44
website www.monty m-o-n-t-e Christo
2:48:50
c-h-r-i-s-t-o dot net Monte cristo.net if you go to that um and you can email
2:48:57
information for the daily Reclamation theology Reflections uh they come out every
2:49:04
morning about six o'clock and then there's there's a whole bunch of YouTube stuff on there a whole bunch of talks
2:49:10
the description of the Retreats everything that Monte Cristo is doing to
2:49:15
get this information out so thanks for the opportunity to to mention that website but it gives you a lot of
2:49:23
resources yes ma'am
2:49:32
okay great so number one is let's look at obligation
2:49:38
the moral theologians um talked about the difference between
2:49:43
Duty and obligation and so just because we're right does not give us Authority
2:49:50
and so this is a this is a modern mistake it's a Protestant mistake that says if we identify a wrong then we are
2:49:59
tasked with addressing the wrong that makes sense and so there has to be
2:50:07
um there there has to be a recognition of hierarchy so for instance if
2:50:14
um if my son is doing something wrong who are you going to talk to trick
2:50:20
question if my son is doing something wrong you see my son do something wrong
2:50:26
my minor son he's 12 and you see him do something that is clearly wrong
2:50:34
almost uh look look to your left
2:50:46
correct and then he talks to me and so what this does is this respects
2:50:51
all offices it respects all all offices
2:50:57
okay so he's um yeah then she still talks to her husband
2:51:04
he talks to him and so now we're back into horizontal flanks
2:51:10
and so he his possibility of listening to you is probably pretty slim
2:51:16
maybe good if you and I go to him together remember Saint Paul's got this written
2:51:21
down there's a protocol for discrepancy and conflict resolution within Christian Community
2:51:27
just read it go first to your brother if you have some if you have an issue go first to
2:51:32
him if he can't resolve it go with another brother then if you can't resolve it go with the priest and then if you can't
2:51:39
resolve it done but you've got to be willing to let it go
2:51:44
but we don't respect the offices we're way too familiar do you guys remember a
2:51:50
time when uh and it's much it's still in in existence in this part of the world thanks be to God but you go to other
2:51:57
places and it's not but do you still remember when we referred to each other
2:52:03
uh as Mr and Mrs even on the horizontal plane
2:52:08
and certainly in front of our children this is extremely important in
2:52:13
preserving the Integrity of office
2:52:20
any other questions yes ma'am
2:52:26
If the parents are unmarried and not together
2:52:35
so let me let me be sure I'm understanding the scenario
2:52:41
as you're laying out it also helps ensure the Integrity of the recording so
2:52:46
in the case of two parents which are unmarried a siren a dam we've got a child and they're wanting
2:52:54
that one of them is wanting the child to be baptized so this is a beautiful opportunity for a conversation modernly
2:53:03
we shy away from this conversation modernly we
2:53:08
um display what we call the virtue of nice which is don't deny the sacrament this
2:53:14
may be the only thing that gets them back together we say this kind of language this draws us outside of the protection
2:53:21
of our faith so it's a great opportunity to speak to this person now you're going
2:53:26
to speak to the damn of the child differently than you're going to speak to the father of the child
2:53:33
so there's a difference The best scenario is to get the two of
2:53:38
them together to have the discussion because what's happening is you are in a
2:53:45
position to facilitate um as representative of the marriage if
2:53:50
you are the parent of either one of those you're disqualified so you have to get a third party you
2:53:57
have to ask me and you can ask them very simply you can say who do you and the baby daddy
2:54:05
who do you respect who will you listen to establish that first
2:54:12
and if they say the only voice that we agree on is Snoop Dogg you are out of
2:54:18
luck so what you have to do is you have to
2:54:23
find out okay is there any voice that the two of you agree on and that be
2:54:28
prepared for that eventuality but this is the beginning of an excellent opportunity for
2:54:35
um conversion so let's say for the sake of argument let's beat this horse till it's dead
2:54:41
because this is a this is a good horse to beat um let's say for instance that you are
2:54:47
just I'll take a wild hypothetical stab you're the mama of the mama
2:54:54
no I'm just hypothetically you're the mama of the mama
2:54:59
and she wants this baby baptized but she's had this baby outside of wedlock
2:55:06
and so you don't necessarily have to beat her up but you have to enter where you can and say why do you want this
2:55:14
child baptized why do you want the church to have an influence in this child's life
2:55:21
does the church have an influence in your life would you like to reconcile that influence do you see how it works
2:55:29
and so don't answer ask those questions in such rapid succession those are weak
2:55:35
questions you ask one a week and then you meet at a certain time you
2:55:40
know an excellent time to meet is right after Mass
2:55:45
and so you know look dear I can take you to such and
2:55:52
such restaurant I'll be available right after Mass tell you what why don't you just go with me and then we'll leave mass and go
2:55:59
you see how this works and so you have to use everything to your advantage because if she's wanting
2:56:04
baptism then what she's really saying is I want to be reconciled with the church as well
2:56:11
she's not coming right out and saying that but you take those those desires that
2:56:16
beckoning and so there's a beckoning going on now you want to facilitate the the formal response to that because what
2:56:24
you're looking for is the consent of both parents whether they're married or not you're looking for the consent of
2:56:30
both parents that's the Box you're looking to check on
2:56:43
wow what an odd circumstance um I'm not being flippant sir it's it's
2:56:49
too common that's the point is we've got this all over the place and you can't do
2:56:56
it recently without consent and so then you begin to pray for the
2:57:01
parents because the child's soul up until the Age of Reason he's not in as
2:57:06
much Peril as they're in those dentists don't apparently sure
2:57:12
baby not only sure yeah because they're not having him baptized now I'm assuming both parents
2:57:19
are baptized maybe maybe not so the necessity for baptism can't enter the familial stream
2:57:27
in the third or fourth generation there's got to be this realization back upstream and then what happens is see we
2:57:35
engage in these activities without proper formation and so then you've still got an
2:57:42
opportunity for conversion and so you can share with them this is my desire as a grandparent this is my
2:57:49
desire for this child to be baptized because this child has a unique position
2:57:55
in my life I have a tremendous amount of love for this child but I have no authority over
2:58:00
this child therefore I'm not responsible for this child but you are
2:58:07
and there Begins the basis for this discussion it's understanding about responsibility and it may even be it may
2:58:14
even start out do you feel responsible to financially provide for this child this is you speaking to his father
2:58:20
and even if you can get a yes to anything then build on that well if you feel the need to financially respond be
2:58:27
responsible for him where does that come from comes from the natural law that's God causing you to be responsible
2:58:34
financially temporally as well as spiritually it doesn't just end with clothing and
2:58:39
feeding him are you going to teach this child stuff you're going to teach him how to fish you're going to teach them how to hunt
2:58:44
you're going to you want a relationship with this child where does that come from comes from the
2:58:49
natural law so just use what you got what's the current teaching from the
2:58:55
church on a fat baby that dies is not baptized so a baby that dies that that
2:59:01
is not baptized so does he die in utero or X utero is he is he before birth or
2:59:08
after birth at what after the partition so how far
2:59:13
after partition well it's different
2:59:18
yeah because there's a reasonable amount of time to have a child baptized and then if he's not baptized within that
2:59:24
reasonable amount of time the parents become more culpable don't worry about the Chow itself okay
2:59:33
non-baptized what happens to the child not the person okay so limbo is still
2:59:38
very very functional concept but let's flesh it out so this understanding of limbo is that
2:59:45
there is a and it's limbo for us as much as it is for them meaning it's undecided
2:59:50
that's what limbo no it doesn't what it amounts to is and
2:59:55
I think this is the correct one is that God has a relationship with every single soul and so this is beyond our purview
3:00:03
this is beyond the things that we can know but we also know that a Soul's
3:00:09
relationship with God is perfected through sensual experience
3:00:14
meaning you there there's hierarchy in heaven there's places in heaven we don't all go
3:00:21
to exactly the same level and it doesn't mean that one level is
3:00:26
better than another it's just that some souls are capable of Greater correlation than other Souls
3:00:33
that makes sense so when you reach your level of perfection that's enough
3:00:39
that's that's Perfection for your soul this is hard for us to hear because in
3:00:45
our equality and our desire for equal consideration we all want to be in the same place it's just nothing in the
3:00:51
natural order works that way so when you apply
3:00:58
to children in the death of children the more experience they have of God through
3:01:03
their experience of humanity they can draw closer volitionally to God and God
3:01:09
respects that desire of their will does that make sense and so you you see that in the same way
3:01:16
in the inverse is there are deeper depths of hell for those who military against God for those who hate God for
3:01:21
those so they're going to get exactly what they want which is distance from God
3:01:35
if a child is important is that child a martyr and become baptism by Blood so
3:01:46
and when you look at the Holy Innocence you look at what is baptism first of all
3:01:51
baptism by Water by the normal formula the second one baptism by desire it
3:01:57
can't be the desire of the parents it's a desire of the individual so we take care of that one
3:02:11
child support is that child then become a martyr because
3:02:18
that baptism by Blood what happens to that child okay so um
3:02:23
to clarify the discussion and I'm not beating you over this
3:02:29
so the churches is not a thing on this
3:02:36
limbo pre-birth death has always been considered as being within the purview
3:02:43
of God protected by God so this extends to those that are emotionally killed and
3:02:51
those who die as a subsequent uh health problem whatever miscarriage but
3:02:56
there was always a consideration given to those Souls that they were within the bosom of Abraham they were in the
3:03:03
protection of gods they would would achieve beatification at the end of time
3:03:08
that that and so your question is now does that person because they die in a
3:03:15
state they die before they can attain a state of formal Grace
3:03:21
and so they have a consideration now you add on top of that the current the
3:03:27
circumstances of their death being murdered and so speculative theology
3:03:35
on it meaning speculative theology means it's unsettled first of all
3:03:41
nothing either one of these choices does not affect the fact that they died
3:03:47
pre-birth and they are afforded a union with God that is beyond the norm
3:03:53
fair enough all right so there's no way to damn that soul
3:04:00
it's there's nothing that a human can do and there are sacrifices satanic
3:04:06
sacrifices whereby the gravid mother and the child are killed ritualistically to
3:04:11
give glory to Satan that's not considered as a function of their will because that child cannot make that
3:04:19
requisite consent so we're back to the consent so the Martyr when you look at the Holy
3:04:26
Innocence and all that is written about the Holy Innocence the 28 children infants that were killed by Herod in
3:04:33
response to the Christ when you look at all the Holy Innocents and what all the holy fathers write about them they
3:04:39
classify them as martyrs and they classify Martyrs as three different kinds of Martyrs and I think this is
3:04:45
important immediately following Christmas on the 26th is Saint Stephen
3:04:51
on the 27th is Saint John the the Evangelist and on the 28th is the Holy
3:04:58
Holy Innocence these are the three prototypes of Martyrs
3:05:04
Stephen is considered the perfect martyr or the Martyr of perfection because his
3:05:09
has heard them both of act and will action and will his will is to die for
3:05:14
the faith and then he dies for the pain not by his own hand
3:05:20
so Stephen this is the thing that we miss in the modern liturgy is in the
3:05:25
ancient liturgy the first day after we celebrate the Nativity we we celebrate
3:05:31
he who was most like Christ Stephen who is a martyr of Will and of act then
3:05:39
the next one we get is Saint John the Evangelist Saint John the Evangelist is the Martyr of will because he dies of
3:05:47
old age but his will was constantly conformed to Christ even from before the passion he
3:05:53
never wavers and so he's a martyr of the will meaning he martyred his will or mortified his
3:06:00
will conformed his will totally to God now from the you can't make this up file I gotta insert this as a as a little
3:06:06
side note John is the only Apostle who doesn't die
3:06:14
at the hands of someone else doesn't die of blood martyr's death he dies of old
3:06:20
age they tried to boil him they tried to stun him they tried they couldn't kill him
3:06:25
so why do you suppose John was was died of old age
3:06:35
he was the only one you couldn't find the others with a search warrant but something happens at the at the foot
3:06:40
of the cross that ensures his long life what is it
3:06:46
exactly son be uh man behold your mother mother behold your son
3:06:52
what does the fourth Commandment say and
3:06:58
and you will live long in the land you can't make this stuff up it doesn't matter which way you come from it it all
3:07:04
plugs in just like it's supposed to and so John is the Martyr of the will
3:07:09
now the third is uh the uh Feast of the Holy Innocents
3:07:15
they were Martyrs of act Martyrs of action is by the action of another that they attain martyrdom they're below the
3:07:23
Age of Reason and so the early church fathers applied this concept to those aborted those killed in the womb those
3:07:29
that died of any age below the Age of Reason by the act so genocide all kinds
3:07:35
of things that has killed babies below the Age of Reason there's they say they
3:07:40
classify them as Martyrs by the ACT and so that's the division it's it may
3:07:47
seem simple and small and operatively it is but either way you look at them
3:07:52
they're afford it is a special place that may be a a more in-depth answer you
3:07:59
want but it's it's a beautiful part of our theology
3:08:10
what's the church current teaching on that so he's beyond the reach of Sacrament
3:08:16
the grace of the sacrament so he's not afforded uh relationship with God conventional relationship with God now
3:08:23
again God is bound to the sacrament he's not bound by the sacrament so any of any
3:08:29
consideration of Salvation is beyond the church's purview purposely the church says we do not
3:08:35
opine own that because the only thing we know for sure is that's that's been revealed by Christ we go back to John
3:08:42
no one comes to Father unless the father beckons no one comes unless he comes through me Jesus speaking
3:08:49
we also have within our Doctrine and Dogma there's no salvation outside the church so you got to square all of those
3:08:57
bottom line the church doesn't pass the judgment what the church says is if you know the truth you know the faith and
3:09:03
you do not Ascent to it now that's different than being ignorant
3:09:13
precisely it's two different creatures all together so if he rejects the faith then God is going to offer his free will
3:09:21
essentially he's saying colloquially you're not the boss of me and God says you're right go your way
3:09:30
yes ma'am
3:09:40
I'll probably represent more of your children that y'all are all praying for in this group that's here right now it's
3:09:47
working thanks be to God
3:10:27
right so if I don't have access to the sacrament for a while but I have the
3:10:34
intent of doing them right and you know not only has my husband he's a completely different involving because he's had all the sacraments in these
3:10:40
Catholics but now it's married to me which marks the whole thing what do we have or like so maybe we can
3:10:47
we can have the actual race because we saw the father but we can't have stack our mental great they're like did you
3:10:53
need to move out or do I need to come out with my kids like I'm a little nervous I'm more than a little nervous
3:10:59
I'm trying to have like what's our plan all right so bottom line
3:11:04
we're in rural Mississippi I am a a guy with a bad haircut and a
3:11:10
cheap suit and you're gonna ask me a question of this importance
3:11:18
yeah so see you're already at plan w
3:11:24
10w they're like you know how to these clothes start to gain a great break and
3:11:29
he can like confess all this and then like tomorrow go get the Eucharist and
3:11:35
oh no okay no I have my enrollment if he didn't get
3:11:42
married before yeah it's too complicated sorry I figured it
3:11:49
might be better so here no here's here's here's where we are with this
3:11:56
is number one is all of these talks have
3:12:01
been of these topics in the light of spiritual warfare
3:12:07
you you guys have some vulnerabilities you also have some protections
3:12:14
what priest will marry you
3:12:19
what priest will marry you yeah
3:12:24
then he is the priest and the voice that you need to talk to
3:12:30
and here is why is because what the adversary is going to want to do is get you listening to different voices and
3:12:36
different people and then he's going to use that as a divisive mechanism so go to one priest the priest who will
3:12:44
marry you and put yourself under his direction do what he says how he says it
3:12:50
and then you get protection and that is absolutely the only way that
3:12:55
you're going to be protected in the interim um so something
3:13:02
this month I'm not like to begin hiding under no no you can't hide so
3:13:09
yeah go to father go to Father Damien just don't tell him I sent you no I'm kidding I'm kidding
3:13:18

3:13:24
yes whenever you call it thank you
3:13:29
name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost Lord God Almighty if these teachings and
3:13:37
these observations and these insights if they have been of you let them go deep within our heart to
3:13:44
bring about conviction conversion and ever increased love for you and the desire for sanctity
3:13:50
