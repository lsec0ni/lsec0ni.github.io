welcome to this video and uh I'm delighted to welcome back Professor Angus da Professor welcome and thank you
0:05
for coming back thank you now many of you know Professor daian
0:11
his work is a a physician an oncologist a pathologist fellow of the Academy of
0:16
Medical scientists and very very extensively published medical researcher
0:22
and and author and uh to today Professor we want
0:27
to talk about your book that you've written co-written with Professor Paul Godard uh now this book I've been
0:36
looking forward to this since our first talk when we talked about various things
0:42
like viral Origins and covid uh going on a while back and uh I must say it
0:49
was my main sense reading this was was one of relief you know thank goodness
0:54
someone has put into concise words the the frustrations um that I've been feeling
1:00
for really for certainly for the last two or three years but looking back now you know for
1:06
quite for quite some years really for the last DEC decade or so so we'll put the links to that do Avail yourself of
1:12
it very reasonably priced very readable to the uh to to the average intelligent lay viewer or literate lay viewer it's
1:21
it's absolutely excellent and we want to talk about this this morning if that if that's okay Professor um few few ideas
1:29
but I wanted to start off with something fairly basic I mean what what what is science has it
1:36
been useful in the past and because if it's gone a bit wrong now we've got we've got problem so so really what is
1:43
science and how does that relate to Medicine might be the first thing to to talk about the first thing about science it
1:50
is dealing with the uncertainty so you are you're you're looking at a problem
1:55
and you're trying to work out the cause or or or whatever or where in this this case where something came from so you
2:02
assemble all the evidence and you look at it and perhaps it can be fairly
2:07
obvious or it suggests one two or three possibilities but the way you then do
2:13
you kind of put those on the table and you say which of these is the most likely explanation for this well perhaps
2:20
there is no likely explanation so you then speculate that this is more likely
2:26
a is more likely than b how can we prove that so you will construct some
2:33
experiments or a hypothesis and the one I like the null hypothesis where is you
2:39
you do your experiments and you you work out which is the most likely and uh I
2:46
think that this is actually what should have been done with covid right at the beginning but of course it wasn't we now
2:52
know that there was a worldwide orchestration to shut down uh the fact that a lot of evidence suggests it came
2:59
from the laboratory myself and uh and burger senson uh were you really sure
3:07
that the changes in the sequence of this did not require actually any further
3:12
major discussion if people would only look on the table all this evidence it was as clear to anybody but instead it
3:20
was pushed under the carpet we were ostracized shut down cancelled
3:27
everything now that is a death of science because we should have said and I tried to do it I took it to the I gave it to
3:34
people who gave it to cabinet and to people who should have known better Sage Etc they should have looked at this and
3:41
said this is absolutely true and and I've been over it before but very very
3:46
simply uh and we weren't the only ones to note this by the way so it wasn't like they say One Lunatic crying in the
3:54
wilderness just ignore them there there was a group from India who spotted the inserts first and then of course they
4:01
were persuaded they were deluded and to withdraw their observations I mean this
4:06
this is a non scientific environment they were completely right and in fact
4:12
what uh What uh Burger my colleague who was looking at it from designing a vaccine immediately spotted and he looks
4:20
at uh when you want to design a vaccine especially if you're looking for reor binding regions you want to look at how
4:28
well they fit lock and key and he spotted what nobody else spotted and that was that the inserts meant very
4:35
high charge and I've referred to this my analogy for that is you wind the virus
4:42
up you hyper charge it so it smacks into the door and a fridge made it now nobody
4:49
would actually look at that and discuss it everybody dismissed it and said all
4:54
changes are random so it doesn't make it and nature can make it random but no you
5:00
have to look at random lot of random changes that are meaningless you can substitute a lot of a lot of uh the
5:07
basic code it is what they encode and what they make that makes a difference
5:13
and I've been horrified at the number of people Specialists virologists immunologists uh molecular biologists uh
5:22
who don't seem to be able to grasp that they just keep reiterating and they
5:27
follow code now one of my uh colleagues kept telling me that you know Eddie
5:32
Holmes was the great genius here and he' made his mind up that the virus uh came
5:38
from a bat somewhere and couldn't possibly have escaped from a virus and he was the great homes and therefore you
5:45
know uh who was I to challenge this that and the other well we now know this
5:50
great Eddie Holmes is all part of uh a a group worldwide that were inculcated
5:58
into uh deciding that they should decide together to dump down everything even
6:04
though they had suspicions themselves and he was one of the authors on this kirst Anderson paper in in nature
6:12
medicine and I actually pointed out that was the one that said that lablak theor is a conspiracy theory conspiracy theory
6:19
I mean it was absolutely natural here here it was and mean I was the one when
6:24
I read that paper said uh that this is the worst scientific paper I have ever ever read in my entire life and I was
6:31
told don't be there that that could possibly be lious what no you know the truth if you actually point out the
6:36
truth it can't be liable this well it's your view in your view this was the worst scientific paper you'd ever my
6:42
this the wor you're entitled to your opinion I've subsequently been shown to be completely correct we now know that
6:49
everything's been released that they were worried that it may have come to the lab and they decided that they were
6:56
going to make a political stance that it didn't so if it was lying it was perjury
7:01
and fouchy uh basically commissioned this he had a gun at the head but
7:07
metaphorically at the head of all we hope metaphorically metaphorically and
7:12
basically he said you know I want that paper in the next few days and we'll get it into nature medicine I believe the
7:19
initial version of nature medicine there was one or two things it's so well described in a another forthcoming book
7:26
not by B but by uh Robert Kennedy Jr but it was finally put in and used as the
7:32
gospel the Bible absolute Bible and then in nature medicine it must be right it
7:37
well and it was uh something like 5,000 um 8 five
7:45
5,800 uh downloads or something and two or 3,000 um citations so along with the
7:52
other and I very careful what I say here complete rubbish paper by daak and his
7:57
colleagues in LW which is even more of a concocted uh put down saying that this
8:04
is they they implied anybody who suggested Le from the lab was a racist and not in the interest of scientific
8:12
Harmony those are the words they use not interest of scientific Harmony well sorry once you are happy that that you
8:20
uh put forward um the nontruth as the truth science it is the death of science
8:27
so this is what led to us trying to to capsulate this uh in this book and can I
8:34
just go and say how how it came about please please it came about because I'd
8:40
been on Good Morning Britain and a few that U radio programs Etc GB news what
8:49
have you and I've been complaining uh bitterly and I wrote in the mail in the telegraph too about lockdown and that
8:56
there was never any need for lockdown it was a travesty and nobody had thought through what are the unintended
9:02
consequences of lockdown so I was contacted by a publisher who said I'd
9:08
really like to write a book you to write a book on this so let's do it so I wrote
9:13
quite a bit of the first bit all about the lockdown and the effects and the effect on the cancer patients heart
9:19
patients Etc and it went I mean it went very well I wrote a few chapters and
9:24
they said well the the uh it's all dying out now let's leave it until the next
9:29
wave well when the next wave came along I mean I thought if you carry on like this when are you going to get it you
9:37
know publish it and and do it properly so it was when I was talking to Paul
9:42
Godard who has been I was at medical school with so I've been in contact ever since very impressed with his
9:49
publication uh track record I told him of this and he said let me have a look
9:54
so when he had a look he said this is perfect for expanding and he said let's
10:01
deal with this ABC and I said and then he wrote These bits and I said you
10:06
realize that we are documenting the death of science here and he said great
10:11
title and that's how that's how it took off and because he' been publishing a
10:17
lot of U uh medical books for the last two decades with his clinical press he said we'll publish it but we won't waste
10:24
time trying to get other people to take it on because they'll always find reasons why and that is actually true
10:30
anybody who tried to publish anything even JK rling can list over a dozen
10:36
times she was rejected uh before she she got accepted so that that's what the uh
10:42
the publishing worlds like so we feel felt that it was much better to get this out there and what is interesting is the
10:49
number of people who've contacted us saying this is a just like you said this is how we've been feeling but we've not
10:56
been allowed to say it and it hasn't been allowed to be aired in the mainstream media in fact I think we'd
11:03
probably have lost our sanity if we didn't have all these networks that are
11:08
been allowing us to communicate all these things it really would have been very very difficult but suddenly we
11:14
realized there were thousands of us who thought like this out there and were
11:20
prepared to talk and especially from my point of view where I saying that since
11:26
the boosters came in I'm seen very nasty cancer presentations and I think this is
11:31
due to the boosters I was told to shut up being carpeted by uh the hospital
11:37
I've been carpeted and said I'm under investigation by the Royal College of Physicians and my argument is well you
11:45
should be looking at this but you shouldn't be carpeting me you should be carpeting all the people that have been trying to cover it up because it is
11:53
absolutely a real fact when I first flagged it I um put it out there
11:59
and I was contacted immediately by people you know 30 mil away 40 mil away
12:05
in leads not everywhere so we're seen exactly the same thing and I said have
12:10
you tried to report it and they said no I'm sorry sorry they said yes but we can
12:16
do nothing about it because we're told it's anecdotal and to be quiet and not frighten the patients even my own
12:22
colleague said you're frightening the patients be quiet I said and you know my my response here is very much I was
12:30
trained and when I qualified I thought my main main role in life in medicine
12:36
was first Do no harm so that's where I was coming from I was seeing a totally
12:42
unnecessary boost of vaccine was actually inducing a perturbation of the immune response that was leading to a
12:50
loss of control of the cancer and having worked with him in a therapy and cancer
12:55
for over three decades now I was the first to realize that the without a good
13:01
immune system control you are going to lose control of your cancer with chemotherapy and radiotherapy you might
13:08
shrink it for a bit but long-term control requires a very good immune response and then I mean I've I've
13:14
mentioned it before but I mean it's it's worth repeating that my initial cases have been stable for over five years
13:21
they melanoma patients and I suddenly had six I've now got a dozen who basically relapse after five the longest
13:28
is 18 years I mean this is staggering to be that completely clear and they have
13:33
an unnecessary booster and two of them had them purely because they had to have them to travel for pre travel to go to
13:41
the Caribbean Bahamas Barbados Etc and if they hadn't have had that they
13:47
wouldn't have had the booster and they wouldn't have developed the cancer and so it's been seen everywhere now this
13:54
should be a red flag but nothing has happened the MH the
14:00
NHS Chris witty is meant to be uh the chief medical officer I don't know what he does but he's certainly a lousy chief
14:07
medical officer I make no bones about that in my opinion because he should have been out there saying this is a red
14:13
flag we've actually got to do something and we should halt the booster in these long-term stable patients and you should
14:20
have done it across the board period because I mean I was coming from the cancer the worst is the the cardiac
14:27
Strokes uh all these things neurological developments I mean people I know uh
14:33
close by have developed Gillian bar after the news I mean which just meant to be a very rare thing and I'll go back
14:40
to what I think is so important when they had the big flu outbreak in 1977 in
14:47
America and it was killing people under 30 so this is different from covid this
14:52
is just this was a panic it was killing soldiers all sorts of young people they went out and did the first mass
14:59
vaccination program for a pandemic and they' inoculated about 42 million people
15:05
by the time the Physicians were saying I'm a bit worried I'm seeing more Gil
15:10
and Barry interestingly it was Gilli and bar with the flu and what this is like
15:15
an O an overall paralysis condition isn't it ascending paralysis goes up and sometimes it goes and you have to go on
15:22
a ventilator canect can affect the breathing muscles yeah but 90% of the time it resolves 90% so
15:29
but it's still very incapacitating and it's not something you want if the
15:34
alternative is a mild flu but this is the difference the FDA uh sent out people to investigate
15:42
this and they documented the background rate for Gillian bar is one in 100,000
15:48
and they documented that since they' introduced the vaccine it had gone 357 n
15:54
and when they found it really was nine and all the vaccinated people they looked looked around and said my
16:00
goodness the virus has changed it's no longer killing people they stopped the
16:05
program instantly uh Draconian and quietly in many ways now we should have done that
16:12
two years ago why didn't we so that's what I want to know and I want scientific explanation justification
16:19
because the boosters as I said they are they are boosting antibodies against a
16:24
virus which has long since left the planet now I believe fisa and these
16:29
people have lied there is no cross protective about that and there are a lot of people to back up in fact some of
16:35
the variants have been pushed forward on studies done on less than eight well eight mice and how can you get less than
16:42
eight mice yeah the Boost the Boost of vac in fact the antibodies produce and
16:48
we proded this in another paper I didn't just work with Burger senson uh on the
16:53
vaccine and the Norwegian group I also work with another group um with fellow
16:58
called Thomas Klein who was the first author in the paper and uh others from
17:04
Manchester who are very very experienced immunologist and we reviewed the whole
17:10
Corona virus history it has never ever worked ever ever worked and they've been trying very hard it's more important in
17:17
veterinary medicine than it actually is in human medicine to get a good Corona virus vacine everyone has been toxic on
17:25
especially once you get up near the uh primary and it induces a thing called antibody
17:31
dependent enhancement which means the antibodies you're producing against a non-existent virus latches on to other
17:39
viruses but instead of killing neutralizing them they make a mass that is much easier to infect cells so you
17:46
enhance the infectivity now the fact that this has gone on is the Cleveland Clinic study has shown that we you're
17:54
more likely three actually the figures are 3.6 times more likely to get
17:59
infected if you have the booster they initially published this in February
18:04
2023 and it was a third more likely they republished in September and it was 3.6
18:11
I mean that is an exponential increase and it's because of this antibody
18:16
dependent enhancement or similar processes and it confirms the other thing that we reviewed in this paper
18:24
which is in Frontiers and Immunology Thomas clean told we published that right in the first
18:30
2020 um showed that there that all the evidence is that there is a thing called
18:35
antigenic Sim or eological imprinting once the immune system with the which is
18:41
why we have no vaccine for the cold which is a coron once the immune system has seen the uh the Corona virus that's
18:50
all it sees and it will not see minor variations and the so-called variants that fiser and Mna are so eager for the
18:59
uh susceptible governments to purchase of them for no reason whatsoever they do
19:05
not induce any protection against the new variants in fact the more you do that the more it will make it worse
19:11
because of this eological imprinting antigenic sin so that is the
19:16
other big thing I want looked at is I believe that fiser and Mna have taken uh
19:22
realize the government's run by fools they're advised by fools and they've taken advantage of this and now they're
19:29
kind of getting wanting us to have jabba jabba jab with the new variance which will do absolutely more harm than good
19:37
so why are we not doing this we it's important to realize that um you know
19:42
Switzerland got rid of all their vaccines about a year ago there's announcements from a majority of Europe they're getting rid of these why are we
19:50
still uh having uh I mean even I am getting harassed and that's the word I
19:56
would use un harass by texts emails telephone calls to have this useless
20:04
vaccine which is using up enormous amount of NHS resources and inducing
20:09
Dreadful morbidity requiring even more NHS resources that we do not have
20:14
because they're wasting them all getting V now I I actually believe that you know
20:19
fisa and madna are completely utterly guilty uh and before I go any further I
20:27
would actually count my uh sense is is that I'm not alone the state of Texas
20:34
has sued fisa for fraud now this this is unbelievable this really is that the de
20:40
the the heart of the death of science big farmer the medical industrial complex have basically taken over
20:48
science they rule the journals this is why we couldn't get our paper pointing out the the Anderson paper in any
20:55
Journal why the refusal was identical because it's all been orchestrated our
21:00
refusal was this is not in the public interest I mean how can you control all these journals it's being controlled
21:08
because if you want to find the origin of anything follow the money and the
21:13
money now is all in the big Farmer and the big farmer if interacted and
21:18
corrupted the governments and I made I said before that I really think when
21:23
I've chased this back I could understand why the leak from woo
21:28
uh the Chinese wanted to cover it up and they did very badly very amateurishly and it was a Dreadful thing
21:36
that they did I thought that's what we were dealing with but the protests from
21:42
uh fouchy and the uh the American establishment was the they do protest
21:49
too hard and of course when he followed that trail back foui was funding all of
21:56
this it was unbelievable he denied it to to Senate and thinks he'll get away Leist legistic on the
22:04
grounds of semantics he keeps changing his definition of gain the function and have you and I'm sorry that is not going
22:12
to Rob and Senator ran Paul as is no fool and a doctor that he's not having
22:18
it he's going to pursue him on this because he's lied to Congress he's like he's had far too much power for far too
22:25
long and to be able to intimidate to sign up and write papers which they
22:30
don't believe in otherwise their career will be this is what you would expect from Putin not from uh a democratically
22:39
elected democracy yeah yeah yeah so having written supervised
22:46
phds MDS 500 Publications um peer reviewed
22:53
Publications all of a sudden you know you don't get get published that that that's just
22:59
incredible and I I agree with you this is one heck of a good title but to me
23:04
it's also really quite a terrifying title because the the the rationality of our
23:10
whole civilization really is is based on on on a belief in science that we have
23:16
common core views that you can go back to something which is demonstratable which is empirical which
23:23
says something accurate about the real world and if we if we abdicate that if
23:28
we give that away then what is our connection with absolute objective reality and that sounds like a bit of an
23:35
elitist sort of epistemological point but I don't think it is I think if we don't have an absolute Bedrock of truth
23:43
that that opens up the potential for a Dark Age of mumbo jumbo and uh I see I
23:48
see it as a real as a real threat I think that's a brilliant um comment you
23:53
made Dark Age I think we really are entering into a new era of the Dark Ages
24:00
you know like in the Middle Ages these are the new Dark Ages unless we wake up
24:06
and we really do have to wake up science was a reaction to religion religion told
24:13
us what was fact what to believe a lot of it derived from the the Bible and
24:19
then uh extra added layers on top and religion became an incredible control
24:26
and some of populations everything science was the first uh thing to rise
24:31
up and qu query what we were told which we could see with our eyes may not
24:36
necessarily be true and of course the the first um great crack of the nut was
24:42
science was the fact that we were told that the sun rotated around the earth
24:47
and you remember the when that was pointed out uh that this could not
24:52
possibly be because they did some measurements what have you and proved Absol absolutely that it was wrong it
24:59
took that the persons who were involved that was it cernus and others Etc I mean
25:05
they were held out as uh um Devils what have you know Heretics
25:12
Heretics word Galileo yeah but that has happened several times and that is what
25:18
science all about now the religion uh the religious aspect had to learn to
25:23
deal with that but still hung on all the way through uh until uh science could
25:28
challenge uh various aspects very well and of course then the religion becomes
25:34
politics and of course religious political organizations then take over
25:39
and the two get blur and then they decide too what is what is real and what
25:45
is not science and I was reminded uh the other day that um that Hitler organized
25:54
a hundred scientists to publish and complete ly trash all the theories and
25:59
ideas of Einstein and put him away silence him and shut him up for good
26:05
Einstein replied I don't care if he it was along these lines I don't care if you have thousands of scientists who all
26:12
say I'm wrong I'm only interested if you can provide one fact that says I'm wrong then I'll take that seriously now the
26:19
reason I coton on to that is because this is exactly what fouchy and DAC were
26:24
doing they were actually orchestrating know a scientists to write to say this
26:30
is all completely wrong and yet they wouldn't listen to any proof so we' we've gone right back so I now see no
26:38
difference between what's been going on with the with uh the the vaccine
26:44
research and the uh the fact that it's now looking increasingly likely they wanted this whole thing to go ahead so
26:51
they could mobilize the vaccine program even though there was no evidence that it would would ever work because there
26:57
was so much money in it and it I think it's just highly immoral and this is
27:03
really the death of science where you have a a complex which actually is now
27:08
controlling the governments and this is really made worse large by the fact that
27:13
W have asked everybody to sign up to say that we need to control the next
27:19
pandemic um and if we don't have a worldwide reaction to it uh things could
27:24
be pretty bad so they're getting all the governments to sign up our said they're going to sign up a load of us have said
27:30
whoa no way because it's obvious because they have uh recruited people who we
27:37
know are extremely stupid in these things and I like Mitchie who was on our stage she's been recruited uh Jeremy
27:45
Farah who was head of the welcome trust has been recruited well Farah is compl
27:52
uh complicit with fouchy and Gates and everybody in how how they mishandle L
27:58
the last one so they want a license to mishandle anything again and I'm getting
28:04
now incredibly cynical I think the next pandemic will be arranged I don't think
28:12
it's going to be chance and why do I say something which I would have said be quiet Gus you're sounding like
28:18
conspiracy theorist here even two or three years ago I would have said that but looking at the facts so we wrote the
28:25
the book you know this death of science before that I wrote the origin of the virus so I've done hundreds if not
28:32
thousands of hours of reading of primary tracks and everything and history I'm a great lover of history and one of my
28:38
very good friends is me too famous historian and I've looked back at it I
28:44
actually began to raise the question if any of the great pandemics since after
28:50
the uh the black death and the Spanish Flu uh yeah after the Spanish Flu 1918
28:57
as it were whether anything since then has not been the result of a lab leak
29:03
nothing to do with a zumos uh jumping across obviously some things can jump
29:10
across being the biggest one in the UK was the um perite that led to the foot
29:15
and mouth disease but that did come from a laboratory it came from uh in in
29:21
competent Plumbing uh letting the uh the uh agent out into the fields and grounds
29:28
where passing cattle and horses picked it up so and then that problem was compounded by questionable modeling
29:34
wasn't it oh thank you for bringing me to that I I'll just I'll just finish off I
29:41
want to say that virt everything and and I've looked carefully at the So-Cal scary outbreaks that we've had like
29:49
Ebola I think if you look into all these things it's remarkable like like Wuhan
29:56
they could well have originated from people working on these things in Laboratories uh with very loose
30:03
containment and my co-editor Paul Gard has written at Great length about the
30:09
history of lab leaks to the point where why would you consider anything else so I I've really changed my mind and I
30:16
would like to see the who disbanded I think it's at the stage where not only has it outlived its usefulness but it's
30:24
actually going to cause more harm than good part of a power complex that wants to control you and I think all this is
30:32
looking remarkably like walking into uh 1984 and animal farms as I mentioned
30:38
again before now I'm so glad you brought up modeling because modeling is I mean
30:46
it is the elephant in the room or devil in the room as I would call it without
30:51
the modeling we wouldn't be in this state we were yeah you know step forward Neil Ferguson
30:57
uh possibly the worst predictor of the future uh ever he should have an anti
31:04
step back preferably but yes an anti Nostradamus Prize or whatever it is
31:09
really unbelievably overwhelmingly incompetent and I'm very happy to point that out because I haven't seen anything
31:16
that he predicted that came true I mean the last flu thing they predicted hundreds of thousands and there was
31:22
something like 80 people I mean it's unbelievably out by logs and
31:27
why is that because they use useless modeling now how can somebody this
31:32
useless still be so dominant and in uh the government listened to him in spite
31:38
of this I'm sure I mean I've been right all the time and still no one listens to me but he's run all the time and they
31:45
lap up everything he says so you can see the source of of my gross frustration
31:51
but Fon at Imperial College is an enormous big operation he's got there
31:56
has just been given another 5-year Grant to continue this speculative Madness who
32:03
did he get the Grant from Bill Gates so the Gates Foundation have funded him
32:09
they are funding these modelers because they're always on hand to present the
32:15
worst case scenario for the latest predicted pandemic and let us not forget
32:21
you know Bill Gates predicted the last pandemic unbelievably accurately uh it
32:26
it was far too accurate for it to be by chance first of all I thought anybody
32:32
could predict something's going to happen but the details are far too accurate uh what Gates did with the
32:39
predictions and the modeling uh all this modeling which is so inaccurate which
32:44
being applied to the uh the recent covid crisis we now know that the Sage only
32:52
allowed the worst case scenarios to go to the government on the grounds if they did sensible scenarios the government
32:58
wouldn't react on it and we now know that sage and all these other advisers
33:04
and in my book not one of them was suitable to be on that committee from a point of view of doing the respiratory
33:11
agency a lot of people were there to work their way up as part of the uh
33:17
their their Career Development all this thing stay within the circle don't stand out don't speak out this that and the
33:23
other it's that it's that sort of environment and I I really feel that
33:28
they should have uh stood out spoken out I mean the people who should have been
33:33
on that were somebody who I know you're going to uh interview in the near future
33:38
people like David Grimes and lots of my uh sensible clinical colleagues like
33:44
Carol sakur uh who's also is one of the few other clinicians to really speak out
33:50
about the the harm and the dreadfulness of lockdown and we now know that you know a lot of us were saying and I did
33:57
this to my friends if you've got a respiratory disease and you don't know where it's come from you don't follow
34:03
the chief medical officer advice to do nothing don't touch anything because it might do more harm than good you do what
34:09
I would call the bleeding office you do what you do you gargle with Aspirin you you you take lots of vitamin D all the
34:17
things that we've known are very good for that these were kind of negtive but it's worse than that because there's now
34:23
very good evidence than that hydroxychloroquine and particular I have ative and Incredibly infective I mean
34:30
there's another book by Pier Cory who I recently met over here
34:35
great and it is the fact that he too was silen shafted everything in fact anybody
34:42
who said anything sensible Peter Mulla is another one of my heroes I think he's
34:48
absolutely fantastic freaking out royan Co Cole they've all been completely uh
34:55
crushed and when you look at at the evidence which I thought was what science was as far as I'm concerned
35:01
they're all completely right because they're all presenting hardl evidence and I've already known how they work um
35:09
because when I pointed out that all we needed to do was suppl the people with
35:14
vitamin D in the first instance right at the beginning Chris witty said the evidence wasn't good enough now this is
35:21
not science this is what I was getting at with the the the religious um power
35:27
play which is then political religious power play telling how it is and that's
35:32
how they've assessed all the science they've assessed the science to feed their preconceived political Notions
35:39
that vitamin D is not good we know that fouy took vitamin D throughout all this
35:46
while degrading it we now know in my res 6,000 units a day I think he took yeah I
35:52
don't know the I know do and if he told me I wouldn't believe menory but what I but what I do I don't
35:59
believe anything FY says I mean he unbelievable I mean and I've I mentioned
36:04
I mentioned in the book that you know I've known him for years and I'm marveled at his ability to make one
36:12
original disc every meeting every 3 months six month meeting he had made some amazing brand new unique thing only
36:20
he had made and then we were to find out that it had been preconiran-food.com years before I mean
36:27
so I just don't trust him at all and how he's managed to build up this uh what
36:32
he's done so uh um back to I forgotten where I was going now well I mean I mean
36:38
the issue is why on Earth why on Earth would you not want to optimize the
36:44
immune system it's the vitamin D the vitamin C
36:49
the vitamin A the Sleep the exercise the nutrition the microbiome and of course yeah say and
36:57
and what I would like to see is is is very large scale Tri trials on your uh Micco bacteria
37:05
vaki because I know that they would work and I can say that with real assurity yeah because it I first made the
37:12
observation that everybody in our trial remember they were all at risk the average age was around about 70 they all
37:21
had stage four cancer so they were really bad but very high year 2020 none
37:28
of them this is before any so-called covid virus vaccine was around none of
37:33
them went down with covid or if they did have a few sniffles that was it none of
37:39
them were hospitalized at all uh and they said they felt really good and that
37:44
they had survived even when their family had gone down with it so I knew then and we know we know why we know that that
37:52
that vaccine is not really a vaccine and this is my big big message the reason
37:58
it's so effective it is it is like a depth charge booster of the dying inate
38:04
immune system which starts to die from the age of 55 it collapses to 70 and
38:10
I've you know I love pointing out when I give lectures on this is that slope of your anate immune system dying is
38:18
matched by a contrary Wing light uh feature of cancer incidence going one
38:24
goes down the cancers go up now that's a very good example of that to talk about science because they're incredibly
38:32
correlated but doesn't mean to say they're causal so there could be many other things so you're you're jumping
38:39
thing it is it's a species argument the two are very related it doesn't mean to
38:44
say it's causal and one of the words we cond in right at the beginning of this
38:49
is how you interpret this data is sophistry basically what we have been
38:54
listening to from Sage the government the big farmer everybody is sophistry
39:01
they only give us the data that fits their Paradigm and they uh don't allow
39:07
us to have all the other data so they have deliberately killing science I know just when I lost my train of thought
39:14
because I jumped horses the about no it's fine it's fine I've got a big list of things we can talk about yeah what I
39:20
do I do see a practical problem with the roll out of your vaccine or not vaccine and uh the problem would be the fight to
39:27
get to the front of the queue because I'm certainly up for it if it becomes
39:32
available well um just to go back to the other thing before I forget so it doesn't keep going is that in my
39:40
researches I found that fiser were funding charities in America to dis
39:47
treatments that were very good and useful including vitamin D obviously I
39:54
have a and I thought that is real sophistry when you're trying to
40:00
manipulate good facts to try and make out their bad and promote them so back
40:06
to the back to the IMM the inate immune system now I have to declare an interest
40:12
I've been pushing the company that makes this IM modulin I've been pushing them for a long time and I believe it should
40:19
have been out there approved uh in the paper that I was um the first author on
40:25
in 20 2016 we showed it in a randomized study in pancreatic cancer I mean it was
40:31
really quite incredible it was chemo versus chemo plus IMM and the survival
40:37
curves chemo plus what sorry that's the vaccine is it the the IMM 101 as they
40:42
saying it's not really a vaccine it boosts theate immunes am11 an immune stimulant it's like so this is this is
40:49
the Micco bacteria VY in this is the one the microbacteria this one was OB obn
40:55
that was chosen cuz it's easier to mass produce than back the effect is very is very very similar and so when we
41:03
published that paper even I was staggered it was multicenter it was randomized and we used the sand of
41:09
treatment at the time which was a gemcitabin chemotherapy and a new one
41:15
had just been introduced which was very toxic so we actually ended up in the trial with not the best patients they
41:22
were the patients not fit enough for these new treatments so this made it even more fascinating our survival
41:29
curves were far highly significant in favor this is a product that be in
41:35
thousands of people in TB trials and they still wouldn't approve it on some
41:42
rubbish about um safety and this that and the other I mean I mean if it was approved then then doctors could
41:49
prescribe it off license couldn't they that's what they should do these are the same Regulators that didn't give a damn
41:54
about the obvious side effects of a a vaccine for an agent that wasn't killing
42:00
anybody or less than 1% over 80 here's something that significantly altering
42:06
not only the survival but the quality of life there was no side effects apart
42:11
from a reaction at the site and like other people who promote things I did this to myself so I know it is perfectly
42:20
acceptable and I mean I never got any uh I didn't even know I had covid because
42:26
after having that and boosting with vitamin D when we had the test I found I had the strongest t- cell response
42:32
against the covid SARS 2 than anybody in my lab had all been vaccinated so it
42:39
show it proves you don't need antigen specific vaccination you need your immune system to wake up and be alert
42:46
for what's coming in and and and professor clany in Australia of course has come up with exactly the same type
42:52
of thinking with with his hemophilus influenza oral vaccine yes which goes
42:57
down you just swallow it goes to the peir patches it's labeled it goes to the lungs it protects the mucosal immunity
43:04
yes very similar approach boosting very it's very similar and it's what's very interesting it's highlighted the fact
43:10
that um the micob bacterian vaki which is the precursor of IMM 101 I it very
43:16
similar but um it it there there was problems making it to the quality
43:21
control that they do which IMM is quite good but um a a colleague who developed
43:28
all this there was uh um Stanford John Stanford and gram Rook developed this
43:35
whole concept as an attempt to improve on the highly significant benefit of BCG
43:41
the old TB vaccine but the problems with a TB vaccine it didn't work everywhere I
43:46
mean this is been I mean it didn't work in the states very well it worked worked well in the UK and plenty of other
43:54
places in Africa but not in other places in Africa so it was that their research
44:00
was what determines the people in Africa that works well and what's the
44:06
difference between them and the people who don't get much benefited and that's when they discovered the mvi and that's
44:12
how they then took it and realized it did the same thing as the BCG and one of the things that uh I did
44:19
realizing that this was so important was that you can only give BCG once or twice
44:25
if you give it a third time you take away that t- cell boosting it does if
44:30
you give it a fourth time you just completely destroy the eological system now this was a model I thought was ideal
44:36
for the covid vaccine program because that was I mean you know the first vaccine might have helped some people
44:41
particular older people recently exposed needed an antibody but to me that's the they're the only people who would ever
44:47
ever benefit from it but the beautiful thing about the vaky obn they did all
44:53
this other work and this is what's real science and they actually show that heat
44:59
killing these agents as opposed BCG is live attenuated so it's live it's
45:06
cultured so it's not very it just turns over half as sleep occasionally it does
45:11
get out and one in 2,000 people get TB it's very easy to kill if it's heat
45:16
killed it can't possibly do that but we found that with the heat killed one you could give it again and again and again
45:23
and it boosts the t- cell system again again and again and again without boosting the inflammatory B response and
45:31
are you giving you're giving this to your melanoma patients at the moment uh those who were on the program yes the
45:37
trials the trials are just finished unfortunately and the company are going
45:42
back to the pancreatic cancer on the grounds that this should give it a quicker approval than melanoma as I said
45:50
I believe it should be approved as it is and be made available because there's no side effects and the benefit if it goes
45:56
across all cancers I mean I I I found that it's been beneficial in all you don't need to worry about does it have
46:04
the antigen on it that melanoma has no no it's not antigen specific it is
46:09
boosting my my guys in the lab who've done a lot of this and here I must uh
46:16
give a flag up for the Institute of cancer vaccines and immunotherapy which have supported all my work the last 20
46:23
years when the cuk turned us down on the grounds that imun theapy doesn't apply
46:29
to humans it only applies to mice and so some my patients so annoyed with this
46:35
they decided to fun themselves without that I'd never have got where we are and
46:40
IMM would never be there and also we' never have got the vitamin D data that
46:45
if if you're low in vitamin D and you've got cancer don't even think of going for other treatments because it'll not work
46:52
chemotherapy doesn't work they're all paliative and that was the the big secret and I must again saying of the
46:58
icvi without them we'd never have come across all these things and because I
47:04
was able for a while to give it to any patient and monitor I found it was
47:10
active in basically all the cancers that there's benefit from eoma lung cancer ovarian cancer um it said about head and
47:18
neck uh it it's it's quite remarkable uh how how pan it is but it it's pan
47:26
generic because it's reconstituting so the the if you're old
47:31
your inate immune systems being just SW out as it were has had the right
47:36
stimulus but if you're young and you're inate immune systems collapse we showed in early work in coor rectal cancer the
47:44
reason it's collapsed after the cancer broke through it spends its whole time
47:49
mimicking Anthony fouchy and trying to suppress uh the immune system and the
47:57
and we proved that because we showed the suppression was severe and then retested
48:03
after these patients had had their colon cancer removed by surgeons and they were there's no other disease there removed
48:10
we tested a month later the immune system had jumped back to normal in these young fit people so that is
48:17
science that is science we remove something and only that's something and
48:23
we prove that the immune system jumps back now the only logical explanation
48:29
for that is the thing we removed was suppressing the innate immune response we didn't give any boosters or anything
48:35
so to me that is science and I was staggered that even a small little juk a
48:42
tumor caused uh that's a small colon cancer expression that we could measure
48:47
in the uh te- cells out of the arm staggering that is proper science and
48:53
this this is the sort of thing that's brushed aside by the the uh complex we're in now uh
49:00
Medical Science has now been totally taken over by a big farmer it is it is really malignant uh if you don't fit one
49:08
of their paradigms you don't get uh funding and they influence the funding
49:14
of things like welcome and MRC and all these people it is truly frightening and
49:20
what I said too why did Welcome MRC the Royal College of The Academy of Medical
49:26
sciences and the uh bizar named Royal Society I mean why did they not come out
49:33
and point out this madness the RO Society are obsessed with statisticians
49:38
and epidemiologists why did they not pick up this and actually shout this out and
49:45
here I think I've said it before but it's worth reiterating Matt really when he wrote his book viral trying to find
49:52
the origin had a meeting with the heads of the law Society to ask about whether
49:58
they looked at all these changes in the virus in detail and they said no it's
50:03
obvious it came from a bat now once the Royal Society can't be bothered to look
50:09
at the facts you really are dealing with the death of science you don't need to bother during the science we already know exactly so they have joined this uh
50:18
quasi religious uh governmental complex that decides everything and is not
50:24
interested in the facts because that really is where we are we are we are we are in a field that's where you know
50:31
Gates and fouchy and Farah I think you all involved in
50:37
uh they were orchestrating this whole thing you know the irony was they got
50:42
millions out of us out of the government Gates founded these useless organizations Garvey and sepy all set up
50:49
to deal with the next new pandemics he funds them all it is very clear all the research that I had done that if it
50:57
wasn't for Gates and fouchy there would be no pandemic so people say you know I've
51:04
been going really big time for China well I mean China were very complicit in the way they mishandled the outbreak I
51:11
mean I think you know the states has got a long the United States has got a long history of
51:16
offshoring uh debatable practices and China just that's that's what did
51:22
because Obama told him he wasn't allowed to do this stuff in the states actually got rid of gain of function no problem
51:27
we'll just do it overseas say we'll do it overseas and and that shows that
51:33
showed it's not just Wuhan they've done it in Africa and Georgia Ukraine I mean
51:40
the these labs are all over the place so based on epidemiological statistics
51:46
alone and said my uh friend and colleague Paul godard's listed these
51:51
things you would have to say if there's any new pandemic which which lab did it leak from yeah before running around
51:58
looking for non-existent Animals uh like bats which fly from a cave to Wuhan and
52:05
over a thousand miles and infect everybody there without infecting anybody on the way over in between
52:11
that's right Thousand Mile Gap yeah now if if the medicines and healthc care products regulatory agency which is 86%
52:19
funded according to the bmj in 2021 or 2022 uh if they ever decided to allow
52:26
Trials of your uh we won't call it a vaccine but your your microbacteria immune stimulant yes um I've had
52:34
comments and without exaggeration I would say two or three thousand comments
52:39
saying where the heck do I get this from put me at the top of the trial you know the trial would be filled in in in a day
52:48
um and I'm just a Pity because I I mean I'm 66 now my chances of getting a whole range of cancer are increasing by the
52:55
year here and the idea that I could reduce all that MH with this simple
53:00
intervention you know if you had some I'd come down and get it now you hit the mail on the head we've
53:06
shown it really works in a therapeutic SE setting which it is difficult to show
53:13
with immunotherapy quite so clearly we haven't had a single negative trial we tried it in um melanoma and a big
53:20
randomized in pancreas that say say wasn't big enough but hey I thought I
53:25
was told when you do a small trial um it doesn't work you do a bigger one and
53:31
then these epidemiology statisticians come in and they go all you need 600
53:36
patients 300 in each hour minimum at least here we had 120 patients uh
53:42
initially something 111 and it was randomized 2 to one when you have a
53:47
highly statistical benefit in in um overall survival progression free
53:53
survival which has never been seen virtually any treatment with regards to pancreatic cancer and no added side
54:00
effects whatsoever why do you need to do a bigger trial I mean that is absolute
54:07
Bonkers uh I mean that's the whole reason we have P values we have these T tests or whatever the St statistic is
54:13
and it takes into account the magnitude of the difference between those treated and those not treated and the number and
54:18
it comes up with a hard numerical statistic that's the whole point of doing
54:24
stats well this is and that's the other thing if you're a small bio uh bio
54:29
farmer and you're you're you're not taken up by the the the big boys you you
54:35
fight all this bureaucracy uh which is just unbelievable I mean if fisa were to
54:41
take this up it would be approved next week I'm sure they would go in there with with
54:47
their team and uh absolutely convince them on safety and efficacy indeed indeed so we we have
54:56
this idea where there's a particular narrative that's accepted and yet people
55:02
all around the world yourself because I listen to people like you me um you know
55:08
um great scientists doctors around the world often very senior people have one
55:14
view but the official narrative is another view is it still possible to come to a scientific consensus or our
55:20
young doctors and scientists and uh people that work in this uh statisticians so intimidated by the
55:27
system that this is no longer possible I fear that what you've just
55:32
said is correct I fear for the University system I fear for the
55:38
education system and I fear for the research system it really has entered
55:43
the new Dark Age and what what uh part of this cause is this so-called wokeism
55:51
is their political correctness political correctness alone is anti-scientific I
55:57
mean that that is it's not in the book but I just thought of it but it's absolutely true political correctness is
56:04
anti-scientific because it's already decided what you can say and what you can't say and how you should observe a
56:11
scenario and how you should react to so it's invidious it really is pernicious
56:17
and invidious and I was say very um vindictive and vexatious uh in with
56:25
regards society and I think we should do everything we can to uh completely
56:30
remove it is a cancer it's a cancer at the society is a cancer in the heart of
56:35
the universities and now we find it's also a cancer that's affected the very
56:40
soul of all government like the Civil Service sounds like and I know that from someone very very high up who left
56:48
because they couldn't stand the fact it been taken over it's no longer the government it's no civil service
56:54
remember the British Civil Service 4,000 civil servants ran the whole of India I mean now they couldn't run the they
57:01
Transport for London it's just that they're that useless and so it is something we have
57:08
to address and and you can only address something once you wake up to it and realize it's there and what it's doing
57:15
it's like you know you cannot uh become a recovered alcoholic until you accept
57:21
that you're an alcoholic and you have to do something about it and that is where we have to be you know with the
57:27
government and the universities we got to S wake up and realize something about it now something else which we did put
57:34
in the book and actually I would really love to expand big time uh because the
57:40
parallels are unbelievable and it is the climate change the climate change
57:46
nonsense is truly uh specious sopic cyric nonsense on a scale that is
57:53
unbelievable and can only be put down to the same reasons that we had to suffer
57:59
covid is the really big players at the top have persuaded the governments and
58:05
everybody of their agenda on the grounds just like Gates and people like that by
58:11
doing the government they could make billions while impoverishing and making the rest of our lives extremely awful
58:18
the parallels are beautiful the ven diagram of the two scenarios got overlap
58:25
abely brilliantly now once again I spent a lot of re uh reading about climate change having realized that all my faith
58:33
at my system I mean I've been properly through the system I was part of the establishment until I realized uh what
58:40
they were doing I didn't want to be part of but it's the same with the so-called
58:45
climate people and the Really the climate people who've taken over they are being usurped the same way as sage
58:53
and Ferguson everything were to uh manipulate the co you know there is no
59:01
um climate crisis in my interpretation of this and there is no correlation most
59:09
uh most importantly there's no correlation at all between CO2 and heat
59:14
in which the whole of this Net Zero nonsense is uh broken and here I would
59:19
just like to hold up I don't know if you can see that see that we can y we can
59:24
see that well plma has uh he basically writes that book in the same frustration
59:32
that I wrote the edited the death of science has the same frustration if you
59:38
look at the facts none of it adds up but he and everybody else is told to shut up
59:44
I can't believe the number of people who are very big like head of climate change in Cambridge and various other big
59:51
people they've all come to the same conclusion it's all a g G antic hoax and
59:56
it's it's like being in a dystopian nightmare come we've come out of Co now
1:00:01
we're in dystopia nightmare of climate change where everything is killed science there's no science behind the
1:00:09
CO2 I mean it it does it doesn't matter really what it is whether whether it's covid whether it's climate change
1:00:15
whether it's political correctness we we should be having a completely free and open debate and
1:00:23
we're just not free most PE I mean I'm okay I'm not directly employed now but if I was
1:00:30
directly employed I wouldn't be free to do what I'm doing now um it's well if I
1:00:36
was employed in in a university sector or probably even a hospital sector I probably struggle um the the the freedom
1:00:42
of debate the official narrative the control of the narrative the mainstream media the way that news outlets work
1:00:50
together to to give us um the names like very Tas you know
1:00:56
anything I mean I mean the ministry of Truth had was called the ministry of Truth wasn't it you know um because
1:01:02
everything that came out of it was true you know it's just it really is quite an orwellian situation you've hit the nail
1:01:09
on the head the the mainstream media have been completely utterly hijacked
1:01:14
and I suspected that and you know I've written uh uh a lot of things over the
1:01:20
the last few years The Daily Mail and the Telegraph and the express and lots of other Publications have you one of
1:01:27
the things I note I mean for the first year or two we could write nothing about the origin of the virus I could right
1:01:33
away about lockdown and even measures to take to protect you getting Co that was
1:01:38
all okay the minute I questioned the efficacy of the vaccine and whether it was
1:01:44
necessarily the uh they went you know the usual thing you write comes through
1:01:50
people edit it then you send through the what it's going to look like in the paper then it goes to the final
1:01:56
editor The mest Mention Of is the vaccine necessary and first of all we
1:02:01
have a questioning whether it was necessary for anybody under 70 let alone children and then we got very I got
1:02:08
violent about the children there's no way in the world you should be looking at untried tested vaccine for children
1:02:13
about this but even though it very logical and it been uh edited by you
1:02:19
know editors made it the usual Daily Mail style it would get custom the last
1:02:24
minute so I was expecting it to come out and I was told no the editor something more important came up and this was a
1:02:30
trend it happened at the Telegraph and it happened all over the place and I must say um Richard TI made it very open
1:02:38
to me when he interviewed me about my concerns about the boosters and cancer that the mainstream media had made it an
1:02:46
offense to question the vaccine Mar and I said why on Earth would that be
1:02:51
because they don't want the public to lose confidence in it sorry lose confidence in fraud in
1:03:00
sophistry when you when we know we're talking about facts that people have had unbelievable side effects from the
1:03:06
vaccine lives have been totally ruined unable to work and this is all very rare
1:03:13
that's the other thing they used to say rare it wasn't rare um at all but he got
1:03:19
he told me what was going on he said the government have made a uh a like
1:03:24
criminal offense or for them offcam offcam would shut them down if they did that so talk about the ministry of Truth
1:03:32
the government were controlling the mainstream media so we weren't allowed to say what we what we needed to
1:03:38
say and I take it you haven't been invited on the BBC recently no I was
1:03:43
invited on to the BBC to do a program about the origin of the virus uh pick me
1:03:50
up and it was a panorama thing and I had about 10-minute interview and when it
1:03:56
actually went out they edited my contribution so it looked like I agreed
1:04:02
with the fact with the fact it came from adal it was the most incredible PE piece
1:04:07
of political engineering I mean the the Russians people Chinese radio would have
1:04:14
been prder TV stations it was disgraceful and of course we all
1:04:20
complained but there's nothing and that's the other thing is the BBC that say is is not fair and balanced and
1:04:28
partisan which they're constantly nailing offc to shut down
1:04:33
people who get anywhere near the truth like GB news on the grounds they're not partisan which is a bit Rich coming from
1:04:39
the BBC they do not listen to two sides of the argument at all and especially go
1:04:46
back while pretending to listen to two sides of the argument and pretending to be Oho righteous yes that's the other
1:04:52
way of doing it you know but back back to the climate change it's exactly the same with that I mean the BBC do not
1:04:59
report things that do are not in agreement with the CO2 this happen we know that climate change's gone on
1:05:06
forever I mean it it ever you have great big Cycles a bit like financial markets
1:05:12
and then tiny little cooling warming Cycles there it's gone on for ages to
1:05:18
say it's CO2 man-made CO2 it is total sophistry they've manipulated all that
1:05:24
data for that and do you really think that if we stopped all CO2 to much you know what would happen if we stopped all
1:05:30
CO2 man-made CO2 out out put tomorrow we'd all starve at least six billion
1:05:38
people would probably starve because it is it's an absolutely important gas it's
1:05:44
uh actually uh increases as a result of global warming from all my reading which
1:05:50
makes sense and it's a heavy gas so doesn't wander up there causing it falls
1:05:56
to the ground where it stimulates green growth plants and trees which then
1:06:03
produce oxygen it is part of the balance of of a a dynamic constantly changing
1:06:11
temporal climate system which actually enables us to live on earth and we're
1:06:16
trying to do everything we can to stop it and if we did stop all uh use of
1:06:21
fossil fuels as a supplying we wouldn't be able to feed the world I mean people do not appreciate that fossil fuels
1:06:28
across the board are necessary for our food chain we wouldn't be able to distribute it and it goes on and on and
1:06:35
on why is nobody looked at this it's the law of unintended consequences it first
1:06:41
came out to me when we were discussing lockdown has the law of unintended consequences been looked what are the
1:06:46
negative effects of this lock down nobody thought that through it's exactly the same about this Net Zero it is
1:06:53
absolutely Madness if we constantly go to this it is it will be it it will be
1:06:59
like the lockdown the unintended consequences will be wrecking our lives
1:07:04
and those of our children and grandchildren for the next decades until somebody wakes up and says oh we haven't
1:07:11
looked at all the facts as if they look at all the facts this is absolutely impossible if a modern society unless
1:07:17
they want to go back to the cave uh to the caves and uh very um basic living it's impossible
1:07:26
to get rid of hosle fuels at the stage they're doing it's impossible for wind and solar and the book I've just shown
1:07:33
you actually really is very useful because deals with the facts the cost of
1:07:40
making these wind turbines the costs of solar energy of decimating enormous
1:07:46
amounts of the the Earth for these the slave labor involved in children I've
1:07:52
read a book called Cobalt red recently about that um really quite um quite
1:07:58
quite disturbing the the the uh imorality of a lot of international organizations that just collect this
1:08:05
Cobalt stick it into your nice new shiny car um you know it is it is a but it the
1:08:12
parallels between what the uh pharmaceutical the the medical industrial complex and the climate
1:08:18
change everything and when you look at it all what is behind it it it's a load
1:08:25
of really rich people and organizations prepared to make us all
1:08:30
suffer suffer really badly so they can get even richer I mean why if you are a
1:08:36
multi-billionaire do you need more money that is that's the big question it's to
1:08:41
get it's to get more power isn't it it is power it is power and then you become in charge of the religion and the and
1:08:49
the government power you have total power but why would you want that I me the heck out well ordinary blos like you
1:08:55
and me can't understand that but we're not Psychopaths so yeah and I wasn't I wasn't going to
1:09:03
ask this actually but do you see parallels between what's gone on now and um let's use a strong word the
1:09:09
prostitution of science that we saw in for example the denial of uh the links
1:09:15
between tobacco and uh lung cancer and heart disease uh the the the the
1:09:21
long-term cover up of the dangers of asbestos oh yeah I mean that's AB
1:09:26
absolutely correct and what again it was the the people with the big money who
1:09:32
tried to drown it all I mean they tried to drown it all because they were on a good number fantastic profits especially
1:09:40
the tobacco trade and uh they went out of their way to remove all links that
1:09:46
they possibly could between tobacco and lung cancer and try and point out it was
1:09:53
many other things they worked in bad environments and the whole thing like that the same with asers it was the
1:10:00
financial consequences it was nothing to do with the greater Global health and
1:10:06
the irony of course that the uh the tobacco trade uh Ed the freedom of
1:10:12
expression freedom of choice in order to uh desperately allow everybody to to
1:10:19
continue this I see I mean I I can I can relate to freedom of choice it's just
1:10:24
but do so on the grounds of full knowledge full disclosure and informed consent but you know in those days what
1:10:32
they were doing I can actually relate and understand it a little bit they really thought that things have been
1:10:39
well I mean I had so many people tell me well I really enjoy smoking the government shouldn't remove that from me
1:10:46
or tell me not to do it gives me real I mean really really good things I I agree
1:10:51
with that actually as long as they know dangers yeah I I yeah as long as they know the dangers and I spoke to all my
1:10:57
life and it's not done me any harm uh in fact I spoke to the head of a a very big
1:11:03
tobacco company uh asking about how he coped with the fact that the product was killing lots of people at the time and
1:11:09
he said he had smoked for 40 years and he'd been perfectly fit and healthy and he had never done him any harm and six
1:11:15
months later he was dead of lung cancer so these are the the ironies of uh there
1:11:21
is a certain selection bias there because someone that died seven years ago of lung cancer doesn't come to you and say
1:11:27
oh I died seven years ago of lung cancer the ones that speak to you the ones that haven't died yet
1:11:33
right yeah uh Professor I've got so many other points um that was fascinating but
1:11:39
we've gone well over the hour on an hour and 11 minutes so um thank you so much for that um now I do have a few other
1:11:46
questions related to politics and science censorship malpractice in research covid versus HR IV virology
1:11:54
gain of function um uh mad make another disease research repurpose drugs harmful
1:12:03
effects of interventions vaccination excess deaths and nutrition but um if you'd like to come back on we could
1:12:09
certainly discuss um some more of those it would be great to have you I just worked out I
1:12:15
can't do all those in the next five minutes no no I think we'll leave it I think we'll leave that one there for now
1:12:23
thank you so much we've done an hour and 12 minutes so that that's okay that's enough that's enough it's it's quite
1:12:28
enough for one go um thank you so much Professor DL absolutely amazing stuff
1:12:34
and just the way that you are able to transpose the lifetime of medical and
1:12:40
scientific experience to interpret the complexity of what's going on now and simplify it for the rest of us um we we
1:12:48
appreciate and and of course we will put the links to this book do get hold of a copy um the I've only really read the
1:12:56
chapters by uh Professor Dow gich and um and uh Paul Godard but there's Ross
1:13:03
Jones there's um CLA Craig there's Professor David nut you know you're not spoiled for
1:13:10
scientific gems in this yes even if there's some bit you disagree with then fine but the whole point is we we are
1:13:17
allowed free and open debate so we we'll put the links for that do do do get your copy and uh for for now Professor thank
1:13:24
you so much thank you very much I have thank you bye bye bye thank
1:13:30
you
